## Intro 

This is part of [Warrens series](/pages-output/warrens) and follows [A Crown of Broken Glass](/pages-output/a-crown-of-broken-glass). If you came here just for the translation, and want to skip the journey to get there, navigate to "Expecting disaster".

The goal here is to discover the meaning of our red hair innkeeper's new name, "Kote". This has been discussed nearly to death. But me and Vashet like to make our own judgments, and that means using our eyes to search out the truth.

> Advice from an old tracker. You want to find someone? Use your eyes. ~ Mal (Serenity)

So I'm going to scour the books, trying to translate far more then the word _Kote_, we will end up making wild guesses, it will be exhaustive and exhausting. However, in the end, we will find ourselves in the heart of a maze with no clear answer, and it _will seem a disaster_. 

## Looking at the fit

### shifting through the dross

The word "Kote" is used twice by Kilvin, and it's from there our journey should start.

> "**Kist**, crayle, en kote," he swore furiously. He threw down the metal tube where it rang sharply
> against the stone floor. “Kraemet brevetan Aerin!”

Kvothe's Siaru isn't perfect, but he thinks Kilvin said "Shit in God's beard". The comma at the end of the first phrase might indicate one continuous expression from Kilvin. [A usage Grammarly describes as Commaa between direct quote and attribute tag](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/comma/). We get examples right away in NOTW e.g 

> "Hush now, you'll get all the answers before the end," Jake said. "Just let him tell it."

> "No need for all that, Jake," Graham said. "Boy's just curious. Drink your drink."

Furthermore, Kvothe might only be pulling out words randomly and piecing them together. This means it's likely our set of words ranged the whole  7 words Kilvin uses. ~~to make you love him~~. This is going to be challenging and involve some guesswork.

"Kote" is used again by Kilvin when talking to Kvothe:

> "I am," he said cheerfully. "Do you know the saying 'Chan Vaen edan **Kote**'?"
> 
> I tried to puzzle it out. "Seven years ... I don't know **Kote**."
> 
> "'**Expect disaster** every seven years,'" he said. "It is an old saying, and true enough. This has been two years overdue." He gestured to the wreckage of his shop with a bandaged hand. "And now that it has come, it proves a mild disaster. My lamps were undamaged. No one was killed. Of all the small injuries, mine were the worst, as it should be."  

Before we get started decoding this, let's take a moment to reflect that if Kilvin is listing things in order, he values the lamps over lives. But let's not get distracted. We have to assume Kilvin would have corrected Kote if he got the first part wrong. Furthermore, even if it's not a direct translation, Ben tells us that "Chaen" means seven. Vaen is close to _Kaen_, an older version of Tak and _faen_, what Bast suggests we call fae creatures. Through, how either of those words would relate to the Siaru word for years is unclear, and I think the similarity likely just a conscience. More unsettling is a word with same pronunciation, "veyan" used by the skin dancer.

> He looked down at his hands curiously, then dropped the half-finished circle of holly onto the bar. His grin slowly faded to a blank expression, and he looked around the taproom dully. “Te **veyan**?” he said in a strange voice, his eyes glassy and confused. “Te-tanten ventelanet?”

It's hard to see what question he could be asking here if they have the same meaning. "Te years?" maybe "What Year?", maybe "What year is it?" A good question if you find yourself suddenly inhabiting a human body, the thing did seem confused tell it was bloodied. The other options are just as hard to fit: "Te/what disaster?" or "Te/I expect?".
I suspect _Te_ to mean "I" or "you". Though it's worth mentioning the rune for lock is _teh_, which means it could lean towards phonetically towards _look_. The Ademic use of "Sceope Teyas" translates to "I'm not speaking", given our favorite narrator Skarpi is quite the speaker, Sceope is likely Speaker leaving Teyas to cover "I'm not", so we might lean towards "I". The skin dancer used the word "I" a lot when it spoke Aturan: "I... am... look", "I look" and "I am looking..." so when it switches to what ever dialect of fae its reasonable to assume it says both "I" and "look" again. 

> He smiled wide at Chronicler, all the vagueness gone from his expression. “**Те** varaiyn aroi Seathaloi vex mela,” he said in a deep voice.
> 
> “I ... I don’t follow you,” Chronicler said, disconcerted.
> 
> The man’s smile fell away. His eyes hardened, grew angry. “**Te**-tauren sciyr-loet? **Amauen**.”

So the chances of _Te_ being "I",  get raised a bit. Also, Amauen is likely "Look". Keeping that in mind might help settle a dispute will run into later. But nothing is conclusive, we just don't get enough to work with. Another argument for _Vaen_ being related to time is that the first seven days (the original week) have the suffix "-en". e.g "hept-en". 

So we can safely narrow down the options.

* kote = expect | disaster | every
* edan = expect | disaster | every

I'm guessing we don't need to worry about _every_ as hopefully it's implicit. But for just the other two words we will have to dive into a labyrinth of other phrases, words, and parts of the language. So let's tackle "Kist" first, which is used several times and always as part of a curse:

> "**Kist**, crayle, en kote," he swore furiously. He threw down the metal tube where it rang sharply. ~ Kilvin

> "**Kist** and crayle," I said, my own heart racing. "What's the matter?" ~ Kvothe

> **Kist**," he swore, then headed back outside, the door banging behind him. ~ Cealdish looking mail man

> the word Furtherence. Furtherance. **Kist**. You know what I mean. ~ Denna

> ever heard from her before. "**Kist** and crayle, I hate that Goddamn play. Modegan faerie-story trash. ~ Denna

If we had to choose a word from our set {shit, in, god, beard}, we should lean towards "shit". Given Kist and Crayle are only ever used in curses, it would be nice to check a list of curses, to make sure nothing pops out as close:

### A dish best not served

Note lord and lady seems used frequently in Newarre, The Univerity and in Vintas. Meanwhile only Manet at the university uses "Tehlu anyway". A point in favor or Newarre being near the University as I write about in [How to get to Newarre](/pages-output/how-to-get-to-newarre).

Any of these words might play a role, but nothing contains "beard", and so we don't have a potential direct link. "Kist and crayle" might translate to  "Shite and Onions". An expletive attributed to James Joyce's piece [Gas from a Burner](https://genius.com/James-joyce-gas-from-a-burner-annotated). We even get the proper version with an _e_ at the end from Pike cussing out Bast:

> “It’s a **shite** rule!” the boy shouted, his hands making angry fists. “And you’re a **shite** little bastard who deserves more of the belt than he gets!”

Given we just suggested that "shit" substitute well for "Kist" in all uses. Crayle never appears on it's own, and its similarity to scrael is exciting, but nothing substantial comes of it. Kote does compare the scrael to a mushroom:

> The innkeeper nodded to himself as he continued to prod the thing. “There’s no blood. No organs. It’s just grey inside.” He poked it with a finger. “Like a **mushroom**.” ~ NOTW

If Crayle shared a root with Scrael and they were both in fact mushroom's, and Kist was onions, this would leave us with the popular dish _onions and mushrooms_. However, I don't see why everyone would be using Onions as a curse by itself. e.g "Onion. He swore" Though I suppose mushrooms do grow in shit. Furthermore, you can't spell crayle without _cry_, which onions are well knowing for inducing. While were on a tangent, let's mention that onion's have another relationship with our breaded master through the latin _Annianus_, which was associated with Welsh _einion_ "anvil". A metalworking tool that features predominantly in Kilvin's workshop, though he was glass blowing at the time he issued the curse in question.

Switching lanes, "en" is used twice by itself "En Temerant Voistra" making it a candidate for "the" or "In". Temerant sounds shinny, and "Voistra" sounds reminiscent of "avoi" which our skin-danced friend seems to use  for "look/see" or maybe "want". So "En Temerant voistra" might be "A look into Temerant". "en" also gets a brief mention by our pig farmer friend as a substitute for "in" in the phrase "wool en tae mouth..." So if we had to bet, en=in.

It would be nice to guess at what "Kraemet brevetan Aerin" means. AE appears in several critical words and is worth discussing on it's own. Check the last section of for a list of every word that has _ae_ in it, There are a lot. 

Visually, <font size="+3">&#198;</font>  tells quite a story, at least to me Here is what i see
like <font size="+3">&#230;</font> an [annulet](/pages-output/the-price-of-a-shadow) (also see the 'annulet' section [here](/pages-output/shadows-on-the-wal) ) or an infinity symbol.  When you draw the letters so they connect you seem to get an H:

<img src="/img/nh.png" height=200px width=200px>

The [Staff of Aescuapis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_of_Asclepius), associated with healing and medicine, is serpent entwined rod.
It's often frequently confused with the staff of another god Hermes, the [caduceus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caduceus), which among a host of other things
is associated with resurrection.

<img src="/img/rods.png" height=500px width=500px>

So despite Basts urging that all snakes bite, it seems the Greek's at least thought some of them promoted healing.

Next let's consider the [phonetic history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86) which paints its origins to look this:

<img src="/img/a-image.png" height=100px width=100px>
<img src="/img/E-image.png" height=100px width=100px>

They look like a tinker and donkey to me. One map even gives the tinker little horns, how cute:

<img src="/img/tinker-hat.png" height=200px width=350px>

They also are the first two letters of Aesop's tales, here is one picked at random: [The North Wind & the Sun and the games they play](http://www.read.gov/aesop/143.html).
This book can found on the Princess bookshelf in the book "The Princess & Mr. Whiffles: The Deep Dark Below."

AE seems like it's all over, but how what value do we assign it? Gran might have
a good idea about how to think about AE. _Arrowroot hain't a palliative of any
sort. It's just good at carrying around what works."_. If I were looking for a neutral God, it would be AE.
Which means either of these two, "Kraemet" or "Aerin", might have been the one Kilvin was talking about. Let's start with all the usages of Kraemet:

> "**Kraem**. No. Not like this." Kilvin growled out a couple words and pounded his fist on the table, each thump as his hand came down was accompanied by a staccato burst of reddish light that welled up from his hand. "No sympathy. I do not want an ever-glowng lamp. I want an ever-burning one." He looked at me again showing his teeth, as if he were going to eat me.

> "Only nobility," Wilem said. "**Kraemlish** bastards with no business having their study here. I think they stoke up high tuitions just so they can complain."

> "**Kraem** no," Wilem said. "He can't go to the Medica. They will be asking to see if anyone is hurt."

> against the stone floor. “**Kraemet** brevetan Aerin!”

> Wil looked down at the tabletop. "**Kraem,**" he said. "It makes sense. 

If you're from Yll  your "yllish" so "-lish" might be a suffix meaning "people of". This would make our curses:

* "Godless bastards". 
* "god no"
* "god"
* "god no"

All of which work rather well. Though I suppose "shit" and "shitless" do to, but that's firmly in second place.

It's possible "K-" is a form of negation or negative. The short argument for this comes from this exchange:


> I felt Master Elodin look at me. Actually felt it, I suppressed a shiver. "So-heketh ka Siaru krema'teth tu?" he asked. How well do you speak Siaru?

> “Rieusa, ta **krelar** deala tu.” Not very well, thank you.

Given re'lar means "speaker", it seems to be that we just slapped a k on it to negate it. And so Kraem could be the negated/evil/bad god. But I don't think we need to go down that road, other than to say it uses suggest it could be _a_ god. 

At best, I can say that Brevetan might share a root with our white-bearded Tak player Bredon. The suffix "-tan" is used in "quetentan~question" and "ketan" both are curious words, but neither leads me to any great insight. It could be used to modify the noun, so cutting it off might leave us close to the core, which is all we need here. "breve". It sort of looks like it might want to be beard. Or even better [beaver](https://www.etymonline.com/word/beaver), which could have been transferred from the early meaning "a bearded man" before it got it's more popular meaning (or it's double entendre).

### faeling faent, naed Aeruh

Lot's of potential fun can be had with "Aerin" It has our isolated AE + rin. If AE is the wind, then what should be considered anything close to rin? rhintae|rhinta|rhin|rhinna|rhinata|rainbows ok.. the last one is silly. _Why make a child terrified of **rainbows**?_. 

Silly, like drawing attention to how its only a _v_ away from Verian, which is tiny red flower. One which kvothe mentions in relation to Verainia Greyflocks name, which he pairs down to "nina". In a Spanish context, Niña means "child". It's often a female name. It's also a short hop to NIN. Which is clearly visible intermixed in with Wind:

<img src="/img/selas-deck.jpg" height=300px width=500px>

In Sumerian, Nina means "queen", "lady" "lord". Gods above, lets not even mention that it's occurrence in the name of Ninsun, (formal meaning "sun"), the mother of Gilgamesh, especially in the _flood myth_. Though I think the commonalities between the [myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh_flood_myth#Flood_myth_section) and what will be limited to a flood representing a destructive event as prophesied by this line in the Lackless poem:

_One a door that holds the flood_

I can't help but wonder if the four plate door might not have cracks because it's _water tight_. Also, how far deep underground is the four plate door?

> The next day Fela skipped her lecture on Advanced Geometries and made her way to the Archives. She climbed down *several flights of stairs* and through a maze of corridors and shelves to find the only section of stone wall in the entire building that wasn’t lined with books. The four-plate door stood there, silent and immobile as a mountain: Valaritas.

And how would it line up with Auri's Twelve (the ever changing pool)? The one she dives into like a fish bringing back treasures like bones, buckles, fulcrums, etc...

<img src="/img/auri-pool-pic.png" height=500px width=300px>

But lets get back on topic, "Nina" in a Russian context is a shortening of Annina, diminutive of Greek Anna, which is short for Annabelle, Kvothe first guess at the name for Denna's patron. I'm sure Kvothe could think of one sunny little girl in her life, but we can't go around connecting her to Denna's Patron because of some hackneyed romp through etymonline.com Madness. What's next, suggesting she is a god?

_Listen, strange women diving into ponds distributing bones and crystals is no basis for a system of creation. Supreme theoretical insight is gained by a comparison of the legends, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony._

_You can't expect to wield supreme magical power just 'cause some watery tart gave you a key, kiss and candle._

_I mean, if I went around saying there were nine chandrian, simply because a moistened modor tossed giant [iridium](https://www.etymonline.com/word/iridium#etymonline_v_12225) gear on a chair, they'd lock me away!_

<img src="/img/auri-pool-fulcrum.jpg" height="250px" width="400px">

I'm sorry, what were we doing again? Oh, yes. 

> “Kraemet brevetan Aerin!”

So like Encans _is_ Tehlu, were not sure if we have one god or two gods and potentially a brevetan|barber|beard in the middle, trying to cut a beard. Or shit in it. Not much help in either case in translating Kote, but maybe we had our eyes opened to some new ideas. Or been scarred, take your pick.

*Edan* makes an appearance in a sentence that's even harder to translate:

> "Tetalia tu Kiaure edan A'siath," he said in Siaru, clapping Wilem on the shoulder as he walked out from behind the desk. "Vorelan tua tetam."

And while I see some interesting words in there namely A'Siath potential meaning Sithe, a connection that would only become possible if my interpretation of a [A Crown of Broken Glass](/pages-output/a-crown-of-broken-glass) is correct. However, I'll spare you the details and say I can't translate it well enough to raise my confidence on the issue at hand.

Another word close enough to Kote that we should consider it is _moteth_, which is muttered by Denna drugged and half asleep:

> “Moteth?” she muttered around a mouthful of sleep, her eyes barely moving under her lids. ~ NOWT

I can't let go of the idea that if you remove the common words from moteth and something you get _sing_. Though what that mean's I can't tell you. The suffix of the word _-th_ is quite common. 

* Keth-Selhan ~ one sock 
* So-heketh ka Siaru krema’teth tu?" ~ "How well do you speak Siaru?
* A'siath ~ family or "bring close"
* Kvothe pronounced nearly the same as "Quothe"
* “Tuan volgen oketh ama.” ~  ‘don’t put a spoon in your eye over it.’

_-eth_ could be a form a possessive. e.g "your one sock", "you speak...", "your family", oketh ~ "your eye...". Regardless, we can strip it out to find the noun, Mote. Which is a letter away from Kote. Mote means [dust visible in a ray of sunlight](https://www.etymonline.com/word/mote?ref=etymonline_crossreference), in the archaic it means _Mighty_. It's also potentially the origins of the word [motley](https://www.etymonline.com/word/motley) which means variegated in color. Only one being holds the mantle of mighty and is _possessed of many colors_, the one, the only the Taborlin. Which is a name I plan on trying to unravel shortly. Also if _-eth_ mean possession, then the use of the teeth in "Tehlu's tits and teeth" might have an alternative meaning te-eth, If "Te" is I and "eth" is possession then te-eth could mean self mastery. Auri and the Bene Gesserit understand the importance of self control. Auri's fulcrum has 10 teeth and one is broken, maybe a representation of the one who couldn't control themselves? Or again if _Te_ is "you" te-eth could be mastery of another, maybe one who wasn't mastered?

### Spoons, sky and the blackened eye

One phrase that wouldn't seem relevant at first glance but is likely the fulcrum to this mystery is

> “Tuan volgen oketh ama.” I said, using one of my favorite Siaru idioms. It meant 'don't let it make you crazy' but it translated literally as: 'don't put a spoon in your eye over it.'

I'll claim two of these words are easy to identify. "Tuan" ~ "your/you/dont you". Sharing a root "tu" as used in "tu ketha" ~ "are you coal". The other is Volgen which longer and so likely fits to spoon. This leaves us with "oketh" and "ama" one of which needs to function as "in eye/in one eye". This ends up being quite a challenge. _ama_ would be a good candidate for eye given there both three letters. 

It's also the first three letters of amauen which is used three times (but really just two):

> The man’s smile fell away. His eyes hardened, grew angry. “Te-tauren sciyr-loet? Amauen.”

Given how many times the dancer says _looking_, it's safer to fit amauen to looking even without the other connections raising the probability of it being correct. We also see it used in Felurians song:

> Cae-Lanion Luhial
> di mari Felanua
> Kreata Tu ciar
> tu alaran di
> Dirella. **Amauen.**
> Loesi an delan
> tu nia vor ruhlan
> Felurian thae.”

<img src="/img/b-mezzanotte-lorkhan-felurian-recuperado-b.jpg" height="500px" width="300px">

Which is trivial to translate of course:

_Come to the seven's mansion, the moon's house._
<br>
_Chance married or marred, beautiful or broken_
<br>
_You mortal man a candle flame_
<br>
_Your love fleeting_
<br>
_We're Divided. Look. _
<br>
_Earth and sky_
<br>
_You of the ruh, of the land_
<br>
_I of the sky, the beautiful moon flower_

amouen:

>  She looked down at me, her expression proud and regal as a queen.
> "**amouen**," she said, spreading the fingers of one hand and making a
> deliberate gesture. "this we call the hushed hart. an easy lesson to begin,
> and one I expect you will enjoy."

and 

> Felurian smiled indulgently. "you are my precious newborn lamb. look! there
> hangs a cloud as well! **amouen!** dance for joy!" She laughed.

Picking based on context and process of elimination "Amouen", it leans "look" but is shares more letters with "sound/listen" or maybe a child of both meaning _pay attention_. Given what we know so far, will have to assume Felurian's use of the word Amouen means "listen", after all, Kvothe didn't have any trouble looking at her.

Here is a bit of a graph to try and pull together some of the Fae A- words and their origins:

<img src="/img/ama.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">


Additionally, "oketh ama" could together be "one dark eye" the idiom now clearly a reference to Skarpis story about Selitos. "Keth" itself seems to share a root or similarity with "dark/black/coal" considering "tu Ketha" being close to "are you coal". The Tinker tells us that "ket-selem" would be "first-night" and "keth-selhan" would be "one sock" the root "ket" seems to be first. Then "keth" ~ "one".  which would seem to fit with _oketh_ being close to one and _ama_ being eye. 

The reason for considering these words is because _Kote_ isn't to far from _keth_. We were left with a bit of a choice. Is oketh _eye_ or is ama? I'm leading you down this road because I think this confusion is planned. This is the deeper mystery beyond considering if Kote's life was a disaster. Is he a hero, the "one" maybe a God? And more importantly, what does it mean to be a god. They're all around us, why comment on one more when he can't even seem to fight off two mercenaries. 

Or maybe the is closeness to _keth_ hints he was the villain of coal~ash all along? Words are pale shadows of names and Bast hints someone truly powerful could take a shadow and... what? Make of it a curse? Use it to keep them safe? I don't believe shadows make us who we are; I think what we choose to hide in them does. So here we are in darkness, turned and turned about in a maze of meaning. Old ways are best, the clearest common road was a **disaster**, but at least it was familiar. 

But like our Inn Keeper, we have saved our fire for the darkest hour, when it will burn the brightest. And our sleeping mind will do more a moment than a decade of spilled black ink could not...

## Expecting disaster

_The door's seals now broken,_
<br>
_The flood gates are open._
<br>
_What a price to pay, to set the moon free._
<br>
_No longer held at bay, by it's will the world tree will decay._

_Look, listen and see,_
<br>
_What a puppet says to thee._
<br>
_Do you know what you have been, what you are not, and what you will be?_

_Bast sees a Kote and expects disaster,_
<br>
_but he underestimates his master._
<br>
_The young act with reckless defiance._
<br>
_A Specere seeks the haert of silence._

That isn't the end of the song, or Kote's... not by half. 

## Translations and further considerations

### Chan vaen edan kote

So if we lock in _Kote_ as expect, and we established with some certainty that _Chan_ was Seven were left with _Seven vaen edan expect_. We left off with a strong argument 
for vaen being related to time and years. Enough to ease it into that slot, which leaves edan to mean disaster. 

Again edan appears in

> “Tetalia tu Kiaure edan A’siath,” he said in Siaru, clapping Wilem on the shoulder as he walked out from behind the desk. “Vorelan tua tetam.”

and the phrase under question. If my wild guess about A'siath being Sithe is correct were actually not to far from translating this first part in some sense: _tetalia you disaster sithe_, maybe "you would make a terrible sithe** followed by "desire your tetam**. That's too much guess work though. o

Ed**e**n is paradise. It has a e, but their switched around and separated by a d. 

Bredon almost has an _edan_ and given many (including myself) rank him high on the list of Denna's potential patron's, it wouldn't be a surprise if he had a negative word like Disaster in the middle of his name. 

Edan appears on the map several times. Near the edges of Ceald on the ocean side: "V**EDAN**TIS CIRADAT" and "The **EDAN**E RETTE" Ciradat is just a curl away from a t being an e and getting Ciradae. There are 3 "Ciradat's" on that map each on coastal areas. "S**EDAN**TIS Bay"  Finally "Ven Veden" is also along the coast and every map likes to put the sea monster to the far east, Now I can't help but wonder if monsters (scrael?) or invaders came from that direction at one point. Edan being "look" or "disaster" would both support the idea that its a place to pay attention to. To be honest, having the word "see" in words close to the _sea_ is somewhat compelling.

We should touch on the idea that kvothe is Andan~Edan~Disaster and so his choice of his new name Kote, might be to distance himself from the stigma of anger and burning. The references to the sea would now play nicely into the theme of "water with fire in it", that we have seen and I think will see again. 

### Kist, crayle, en kote

I suspect the translation of "Kist, crayle, en kote," is akin to "Shit and onions in my eye." or simply put, "I can't see shit". recall that the lighting had changed in the Fishery and possible it was throwing the Masters keen eye off:

> I hoped the change in light was due to a new lamp.
> Kilvin's mood was always foul when one of his lamps went unexpectedly dark.
> Scanning the rafters, I didn't see any dark lamps. It took me a long moment to realize the strange
> quality of the light was due to actual sunlight slanting in through the low windows on the eastern wall.
> Normally I didn't come to work until later in the day.

Or maybe his goggles were fogged:

> "Kist, crayle, en kote," he swore furiously. He threw down the metal tube where it rang sharply
> against the stone floor. “Kraemet brevetan Aerin!”
> 
> I fought down the sudden urge to laugh. My Siaru wasn't perfect, but I was fairly certain Kilvin had
> said, Shit in God's beard.
> 
> The bearlike master stood for a long moment, looking down at the ruined glass on the floor. Then
> he let out a long, irritated breath through his nose, pulled off his **goggles**, and turned to look at me.

Meanwhile, by itself:

> “Kraemet brevetan Aerin!”

Might be "blackened beard of god". Though the whole thing might functionally come across as "I cant see through the blackened beard of god". Though putting Aturn prudishness aside, if brevetan did lean towards the slang term for beaver, there might be some far-reaching implication. 

But regardless, Seer. Kote didn't _v_ e _h_ / submit, he rolled the dice and all of creation is tumbling with the throw.

## Grammar implications

So I'm claiming in a round about way that Kote, as Kilvin uses it, means "expect". In the sentence "Chan vaen edan kote" that would place it at the end. A word for word swap would give us "Seven years disaster expect". It would be nice to see this language pattern repeated. Or at least a hint of it. Let's look at some other Siaru translations. Here is Kvothe replying to Elodin:

> I felt Master Elodin look at me. Actually felt it, I suppressed a shiver. “So-heketh ka Siaru krema’teth tu?” he asked. How well do you speak Siaru?
> 
> “Rieusa, ta krelar deala tu.” Not very well, thank you.

I might have mentioned this, but _tu_ is likely "you", so our first try would seem to validate the idea that we can't just swap words. Language translation rarely works that way, but it would be distressing if it did work in other cases. Bonus, does "ta" mean "I/me"? Let's try another, and will leave it to the audience (you) to find a grammar for the language. Here is Kvothe talking to Roent:

> I nodded solemnly. “Rieusa, tu kialus A’isha tua.” Thank you for bringing me close to your family.

_tua_ is likely "your". We also easily get _Reiusa_ as "Thank you" which leaves only _Kialus_ or _A'isha_. Again, word swapping would get you: "Thank you, you kialus A'isha your". Which makes no sense in English no matter how we fit our remaining words. While were here, lets try to translate this. First off, using "tu" as "you" here is also awkward, and I wonder if it doesn't change meaning based on position. Given how are hunter Scriv uses the word "A’siath," I have a hunch "A'-" implies group or collection, so I'm leaning towards A'isha as family. The only close word to _kialus_ is _Kiaure_, also used by the Scriv. It's rather dangerous to translate based off only three points however. 

The point is, Siaru doesn't work like English, we shouldn't expect the words to line up, we don't know the grammar.
