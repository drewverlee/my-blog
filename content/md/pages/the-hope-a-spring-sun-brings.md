This is a piece on how to read the KKC and so I'll share this advice, although
things may seem poetic, the words Kote speaks are prophetic. In among the musing
of his prose, deeper truths you should seek to know. Every word a cipher, ever
gesture a mystery. Now this I say and attend to me. Things are not right in
these four corners. Look to the borders, the jokes, the games, the children's
songs...

_When you see a face out of place?_
<br>
_What to do? What to do?_
<br>
_slowly explore, look for more._

_Catch a familiar gesture?_
<br>
_Where to turn? How to learn?_
<br>
_Buried treasure, take its measure._

_Hear a songlike strangeness?_
<br>
_Unusual metaphor, things said before?_
<br>
_Don't ignore, seek the door._

_See the blackened rotten dross?_
<br>
_Understand it's cost,_
<br>
_Before all hope is lost._

_The world is crying out its name._
<br>
_It's up to you to see it's pain._
<br>
_What's their shame? What hope they gain?_

_Chandrian. Chandrian_
