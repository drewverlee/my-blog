# The one who remembered

This story is about the Chandrian, about the one who remembered the Lethani. It's about slow regards, widdershins, woes, and flickering light upon distant half built walls. 

This story is about Auri and what a look entails.

Shehyn tells us that seven forgot the Lethani, and six cities were betrayed. One remembered the Lethani, and did not betray a city. The name of the one was forgotten but not gone. Bound to shadow, life, and loss. We hear of her in children's rhythms and manling tales:  

> The Chandrian move from place to place,  
> But they never leave a trace.  
> They hold their secrets very tight,  
> But they never scratch and they never bite.  
> They never fight and they never fuss.  
> In fact they are quite nice to us.  
> They come and they go in the blink of an eye,  
> Like a bright bolt of lightning out of the sky. ~ TWMF:128  

Auri moves around the University like a ghost, small, hallow and pale floating above or scurrying in the far below bottom of things. She knows the key to being small and staying unseen:

> "Nobody sees me." ~ Auri NOTW:372

She is nice to us, and she does hold her secrets tight. If asked to too much, she _does_ disappear in a barb of light:

> I forgot to be
> careful and asked her a question, “Auri, how do you know about the Ciridae?”
> There was no response. The next flicker of **lightning** showed me nothing but an empty rooftop and an unforgiving sky. ~ TWMF:194

Auri carries a blue-green light. 

> Foxen’s light continued to swell. First the merest flickering: a fleck, a
> distant star. Then more of him began to iridesce, a firefly’s worth. Still more
> his brightness grew till he was all-over tremulant with shine. Then he sat
> proudly in his dish, looking like a blue-green ember slightly larger than a
> coin. ~ SROST:2

And as names have power, the name of her light tells us much.  She calls it foxen because it's [foxfire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxfire). The blueish-green glow is attributed to a luciferase, an oxidative enzyme, which emits light as it reacts with luciferin. Luciferin whose etymology ties back to lucifer "light bearer" and "fallen angel". We see their glow below in the Underthing and then as the story shaped, your imagination gives them wings to fly, we see them in the fae another way:

> For several minutes I strained my eyes and ears to no avail. Then I saw something luminous in the
> distance. It disappeared quickly, and I thought my light-starved eyes were playing tricks on me. Then I
> saw another flicker. Two more. Ten. A hundred pale lights danced toward us through the trees, faint as
> **foxfire.** ~ TWMF:663

Though she bears the light, she doesn't turn the hearthfire to blue. Blue tinged flame is caused by [rapid decay](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/ojlxho/who_and_what_turns_the_flames_blue/). A hint which Laurian gives us early on:

> "Let me think ..." Ben said. "Blue flame is obvious, of course. But I'd hesitate to attribute that to the Chandrian in particular. In some stories it's a sign of demons. In others it's fae creatures, or magic of any sort."
> "It shows bad air in mines, too," my mother pointed out.
> "Does it?" my father asked.
> She nodded. "When a lamp burns with a blue haze you know there's firedamp in the air." ~ NOTW:86

Firedamp is flammable gas, and is the result of black coal. Which is formed by the decay of plants and converted to a more solid structure by pressure and heat over a long long time. And so given an accelerated (magical) rate of decay would lead to blue flames. Rapid decay which we see at both the Troupe Massacre and the ash and ember remains of the Mauthen farm:

> I moved to sit on the edge of the water trough, but the thick planking crumbled under my weight like a rotten stump. I let gravity pull me the rest of the way down and sat on the grass. ~ NOWT:545

To strengthen the connection were given an example of the consumption (like the decaying process) of plants by the Draccus, which leads to gas (like firedamp) being converted to blue fire:

> "..The author suggested that the draccus just stores that gas in a bladder of some kind..." ~ NOTW:585

This means it's Usnea, connected with decay, who _turns_ flames blue. This means Auri was not there that horrible day. These secrets, like Auri, are not easily found. Her story not lost, but faded in time, look for it in the corner of your eye. She is Perial who sparred the world from the angry dark in all men's hearts:

> Then Tehlu grew angry, and he might have slain them all, but Perial leaped forward and laid a restraining hand on his shoulder. ~NOTW:167

And gave us this small remnant of the world we call Temerant. She is Princess Arial, who Kvothe will save from Haliax, who hunts her across time and is the reason she is hiding:

> Auri handed me another bottle and we repeated the process. When the fourth bottle was swept out
> into the swirling water, Auri nodded and dusted her hands briskly against each other.
> “There,” she said with a tone of immense satisfaction. “That’s good. **We’re safe.**” ~TWMF:197

Their struggle distorted through so many tales. The story of Taborlin has it's roots in Lanre's journey from death to life, escaping a prison no man had before. Her true story is woven into that as well, as a force that stands between him and his full power. Without the notes of song to keep it true, farmers have her name and gender go askew. She wouldn't be the first [Ariel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_(The_Tempest)) to undergo such a treatment at the hands of history.

A power she denied him when she remembered the Lethani, the graceful way to move through the world, she talks about it as the proper way:

> It was worth it, doing things the **proper way**. ~ 11

> Auri helped everything to find its **proper place** ~ 24

> She was so tired of being all herself. The only one that tended
> to the **proper turning*** of the world. ~ 93

> She stepped the way the water moves within a gentle wave.
> Never mind the motion, the water stays unchanged. That was the **proper way of things.** ~ 54

> She was a
> greedy thing sometimes. Wanting for herself. Twisting the world all out of
> **proper shape**. Pushing everything about with the weight of her desire. ~ 35


Kvothe gave her hope, song, laughter and a new name. He thinks it means "sunny". But I believe her long name is written upon the dark night sky. She is reflected starlight, and though her touch is small, it pushes down like fulcrum upon the world:

> She pulled to turn the gear upon its
> narrow ledge of rock. She spun it widdershins. The breaking way. It tipped from
> tooth to tooth. She spun the brazen gear and only then did Auri understand the
> fearsome weight of it. It was a fulcrum thing. It was a pin. A pivot. It
> shifted, tilted, but truthfully it only seemed to turn. In truth, it stayed. It
> staid. In truth the whole world spun. ~ SROST:117

And it bends to her desire:

> The other piece? That slender tenth part of a tenth? The heart of alchemy was
> something Auri had learned long ago. She’d studied it before she came to
> understand the true shape of the world. Before she knew the key to being small.
> Oh yes. She’d learned her craft. She knew its hidden roads and secrets. All the
> subtle, sweet, and coaxing ways that made one skilled within the art. So many
> different ways. Some folk inscribed, described. There were symbols. Signifiers.
> Byne and binding. Formulae. Machineries of maths... But now she knew much more
> than that. So much of what she’d thought was truth before was merely tricks. No
> more than clever ways of speaking to the world. They were a bargaining. A plea.
> A call. A cry. But underneath, there was a secret deep within the hidden heart
> of things. Mandrag never told her that. She did not think he knew. Auri found
> that secret for herself. She knew the true shape of the world. All else was
> shadow and the sound of distant drums. Auri nodded to herself. Her tiny face was
> grave. She scooped the waxy fineground fruit into a sieve and set the sieve atop
> a gather jar. She closed her eyes. She drew her shoulders back. She took a slow
> and steady breath. There was a tension in the air. A weight. A wait. There was
> no wind. She did not speak. The world grew stretched and tight. Auri drew a
> breath and opened up her eyes. Auri was urchin small. Her tiny feet upon the
> stone were bare. Auri stood, and in the circle of her golden hair she grinned
> and brought the weight of her desire down full upon the world. ~ SROST:145

Her story is at the hidden heart of things, a recipe, an alchemy, the desire to shape his way. See her mantle, her shadow, power and shame. The truth chiseled deep in grey moon stone, a pillar pulled from the heavens and across the land,  now on-top of Jax's broken home:

> vorfelan rhinata morie 
> Wil glanced up. “The desire for knowledge shapes a man,” he said. “Or something close to that.” ~NOTW:237

Close, but not quite, try casting the words in a different light:  "The desire for knowledge to shape mankind". And yet, there still there is more, look to the edges, the songs and the children's stories:

> “I have made a home for you,” Jax said, gesturing to the vast mansion below them. “There is sky
> enough for you here. An empty sky that is all for you.”

> “I must go,” she said. “I have been away too long.”
> He raised his hand as if to grab her, then stopped himself. “Time is what we make it here,” he said.
> “Your bedroom can be winter or spring, **all according to your desire**.” ~ TWMF:595

For love of light he stole her from the night, it fits the meaning just right:

_ALL TO HER DESIRE_  

_Auri I name you._  

_Shattered mirror-glass and clean fire._    
_Fallen star and shadow cast._    
_The one who remembered._    
_Beautiful and broken_.   
_Light Bearer._   
_Cyphus_   

So now you know the hidden heart of things, and only time will tell if this truth sings.
