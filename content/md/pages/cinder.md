_Numbness deep within weary bone._  
_Chill harder than cruel stone._   
_The snow wears a nightmares smile,_   
_and beckons me to stay a while._   
_I lay my head upon its soft embrace,_   
_and in it's glow, I see your face._

## Intro

This is part of [Warrens](/pages-output/warrens) series and directly follows [Tending](/pages-output/tending). The story we follow is a web of fine silver too thin to see. So we must test the air and see which way the wind moves around it. And so sometimes the only way forward is to go back, to pick far away points in the sky and follow them however unremarkable they seem. Here and now, will discuss the nature of Grams and walking nightmares. 

## A shared nightmare
 

Recall that a gram requires sympathy to make, an art some speculate [Lanre has learned](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/l6ceer/some_sympathy_for_lanre/). It's a useful tool to have if your adversary has ~~wings~~ rings of power, which Lanre/Haliax's foes, the Amyr, likely do. Furthermore, we're told all roads end in death but one. And given Taborlin and Lanre both have escaped from a prison no man has before, it's plausible some of [Taborlin's story are about Lanre](http://mattytangle.co.uk/cell-division/). In which case we have narrative precedence that Haliax might have a gram:

> It was _black as a winter night and cold as ice to touch,_ but so long as it was round his neck, Taborlin would be safe from the harm of evil things. Demons and such.” ~NOTW:185

The amulet bears a striking resemblance to Kvothe's chilly antagonist. Cinder has a quicksilver grace, eyes as black as starless night, and is a creature of winter's pale. Cinder is a tool in Haliax's hand, and the distance might only weaken the bound, not break it.

Neither the Lethani, nor truth is a straight road, and so we must make a three way binding and pull clues from the all over the story. Like a gram, ashes draw malicious substances to them, an act we see when it pulls the denner from Denna. Similarly, Cinder's eyes and sword absorb the light. We have now firmly established the _what_, but what we lack is the _how_. For that, we need to turn to our foremost fae expert, Bastas. He tells us that the fae would never call what they do magic, instead they speak of _art_, _craft_ or _shaping_. But formally, they would call it _glammmourie_ and _grammarie_. Auri says alchemy is _art_ and between these narrow roads we see the wider truth. All roads lead to Tinue, all stories are one, and we're left to connect the third side of our triangle and in its center, we see a truth only Auri understands. That all magics can be bent in the same direction, and artificing is grammarie through another medium.

Art_ificing is the _art_ of making a _gram_. _Gram_marie is the art of making something be more than it is. For example, a woman could become the most beautiful woman for everyone, like Felurian. The target of every man's desire. Similarly, metal mixed with blood, could become more _you_ than _you_, a target for malfeaseance. 

To construct a guilder (a gram), giller needs to put themselves (or another's) substance into the metals.  Blood, bone, spit, skin, hair, and urine are used, the same ingredients as for a simulacra. Only Grams are metal mixed with _coal_ due to absorption properties. Both are used as a way to direct sympathy, towards or away. Everything has its inverse, and so if the guilder is _more_ than metal it's also _less_ than its creator. Cinder is Rhinta, shaped to be _more_ and _less_ than a man, the target of all our fears.



## The lye that lies beneath

And for the final piece we have to travel underground and join Auri as she makes her soap. She runs the ash through water to create lye, a predominate ingredient in soap. But if your getting tin foil tingles than your not crazy, at not yet at least. Auri's descriptions of the lye are uncannily similar to Cinder. Auri calls the lye cinderwash and says its _wanton_ (lacks control), stately, and graceful. She even breaks homonym barrier and says it contains caustic _lies_ (should be lye). Auri is _truly powerful_, her soap making is _magic_ on a scale we can't fathom the repercussions of. 

Your close now, the truth tingles in the back of your mind like butterfly wings. Bast outlines the door in broad strokes. It was right there, right at the start of everything, waiting for you to come back to it....

> “That’s grammarie. Now imagine if someone could take a knife and make it be more
> of what a knife is. Make it into the best knife. Not just for them, but for
> anyone.” Bast picked up his own knife and closed it. “If they were
> really skilled, they could do it with something other than a knife. They could
> make a fire that was more of what a fire is. Hungrier. Hotter. Someone truly
> powerful could do even more. They could take a shadow …” He trailed off gently,
> leaving an open space in the empty air.

## Epilogue

Like so much magic, if try to hard to understand, it falls apart. And so we must weave our story from the moon's light and not look to close. For in the shadows the beating heart of the mystery still lies. We dear not approach it directly, instead we must find the graceful way to move and hope it will come to us and let its [De sidere](/pages-output/desire).
