This is a WIP, 
 
The closest word i see to reshi is rhis, because its used directly by bast and its only a couple letters away

> bast says it like its a very good place
> It’s lovely stuff. It’s halfway to Rhis, and that’s not something I say lightly.”

The other word thats fairly close it Reis from "Feltemi Reis". Which comes up enough for it to be important. Will have to do a quick side journey to see if we can learn anything about it.

#### Feltemi reis

The conclusion in looking into feltemi reise isn't great, feel free to skip this.


>  I agreed to go, as I’d heard the players were doing Feltemi’s original and not one of the expurgated versions. It was well suited to my mood, full of dark humor, tragedy, and betrayal.

> “Have you read the Lights of History by Feltemi Reis?”

> Feltemi Reis’ Fall of Empire alone took me ten hours.

> “Curious, the arcanist asked a few questions and the Edema admitted he didn’t know who Feltemi Reis was, or what a gearwin did. The arcanist continued for a long hour, first out of curiosity, then with dismay. The final straw came when he discovered the boatman couldn’t even read or write.

So Feltemi was a historian and a playwright. He wrote "Fall of Empire" and "Lights of History"

I talk about potential empires here when i discussed which [law ventoran passed](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/kkivw6/what_law_did_ventoran_passed/). Spoiler i don't know.

But another option is Ergen. Which would date Feltemi quite a bit.

> The war was called the Creation War, and the empire was called Ergen

"Lights of History" is interesting. Stars are lights, Haliax refers to Aleu falling from the sky like shooting stars:

> Aleu fall nameless from the sky

I haven't actually thought about what Alue are. Here are some words that are close and notable end with something close to  "lu" 

* Teh-lu ~  possible "lock" and part of the moons name ludis
* A-lue  ~ we should look into the stars in another place.
* Bea-u  ~ "from ma thinks i have a beau at the university" spoken by nina who i would bet my cat is a chandrian. So if "-u" suffixes are for near deities then this might be a double meaning. refering to any number of people including what/how ever is behind the four plate door.
* rehu ~ I guessed this means something close to women
* Lhin ta Lu soren hea. ~ An analysis of this will be forth coming, but i found nothing immediately helpful
* felurian ~ needs no introduction
* vellum ~ high quality paper, used in the book of the path and by maer alveron.
* meluan ~ maer's lady love, hates kvothe and likely kvothes aunt.
* luckless ~ jax is refered to as luckless which is a short hope to lack-less. which is intresting because it would mean
that while he trapped part of the moon's name he does't have the lock? Or he does have the lock? remember less-talons was there way of giving kvothe talons, so its easy to see this both ways.
* lute ~ funny enough if lu is part of the moon, and teh is short for lock then lute is luteh ~~ tehlu
* tenaculum ~ anti corrosive material auri applies to damaged black iron pipes
* ludis ~ the name the moon gives jax

In conclusion, it's hard to take anything away from the use of "lu" in words. The people felurian, meluan, tehlu, likely all have some relationship, but how we would connect that make to the aleu in a meaningful way here i fall to see. At least
not without diving much deeper into how the Lights from "lights of history" could be the Alue, and what/who that would be
in the story. Nothing that will give us enough evidence on how to translate 'lu' any better right now.

If we look at the name "feltemi reis" and focus on feltemi its close to

"fel" which could be fae or fallen fae. temi is close to temic and tempa tempi. The later are iron and little iron. So at a glance we might have fallen fae iron. Tehlu wields iron in righteous fury, if anyone was going to take a fall and become fallen iron, it would be him. This might lead some of you to consider that Haliax could be feltemi reis. Which seems a stretch. 

Let's leave that for now.

#### re

Ok, lets try our hands at reshi. Assuming "re" means feminine. I know that's weird. we can explore other options elsewhere

re- feminine

re also appears in a couple words a lot of which are locations: 

* imre
* admere
* newarre 
* renere 
* Maedre is a name given to kvothe.

so feminine AND OR a place. 


#### shi

comes up no where else. I'm not one for looking outside the book. Someone could go hunting for greek, or norse gods.

Bast says

> It’s lovely stuff. It’s halfway to Rhis, and that’s not something I say lightly.”

So at best we could consider "shi" wonderful place. Which doubles "reshi" two connections to a place. One of them "heavenly".   .

# aesh

reshi

TODO aesh ~ "no arrow" ~  from Aethe Ae ~ Arrow/man. The ~ to havet
Rethe ~ re? fethear? fletching? woman

# reshi

re ~ fletching/feather 
shi ~ without

without feather

> she mused softly to herself. “yet you are all iron-bitten. you are a sweet bird that cannot fly. no bow. no knife. no chain.”

# post

We start with the a quote from Tempi

> “Aesh. No arrow.”

It seems reasonable to assume Aesh means "no arrow". But which part is negation and which part is Arrow. Another Ademe word/person might give us the hint: Aethe, who
founded the school  and sought mastery over the bow and **arrow**. Let's leave discussion of the later half of his name for later and assume "Ae" is Arrow. Let's consider
his troublesome student, Rethe, whose name conspicuously differs only by the first two letters **Re**.  Here is the stretch, If Aethe is famous for his Arrow. Then what might
Rethe be known for? I like to look for balance when I have two birds of a feather:

> She took a white feather from the arrow’s **fletching**, dipped it in her blood, and wrote four
> lines of poetry.

so Re might mean feather/fletching/bird? "Re" is also implied to be feminine, as It's used both by Re'the and Roents wife Reta. But if that unsettles you, then leave it aside.
The word "Aesh" might give us another hint "no arrow" so Sh is like negation. So where I'm i going with this?

Could Re-shi mean without arrow / without feather?  without wings maybe? Felurian seems to think kvothe can't fly

> Felurian turned over my hand and examined my palm and fingers closely. “you are not a fighter,”
> she mused softly to herself. “yet you are all iron-bitten. you are a sweet **bird that cannot fly**. no bow.
> no knife. no chain.”

Though why Bast would call his master by such a discouraging name given his near worship is something of a mystery. 


# post revised

We start with some words by Tempi

> “Tempi?” I called.
> “Here,” he replied from off to my left. “**Aesh. No arrow.**”
> More arrows sang overhead, a few of them sticking into trees.

It seems reasonable to assume **Aesh** means **"no arrow"**. But which part is negation and which part is Arrow. Another Ademe word/person might give us the hint: Aethe, who
founded the school and sought mastery over the bow and **arrow**. Let's leave the discussion of the later half of his name for another time and assume "Ae" is Arrow or maybe Wind, either way, it's at the heart of H**ae**rt . Let's consider
his troublesome student, Rethe, whose name conspicuously differs only by the first two letters **Re**.  Here is the stretch, If Aethe is famous for his Arrow. Then what might
Rethe be known for? I like to look for balance when I have two birds of a feather:

> She took a white feather from the arrow’s **fletching**, dipped it in her blood, and wrote four
> lines of poetry.

so Re might mean feather/fletching/bird? "Re" is also implied to be feminine, as It's used both by Re'the and Roents wife Reta. But if that unsettles you, then leave it aside.
The word "Aesh" might give us another hint "no arrow" so Sh is likely negation. So where I'm i going with this?

Could Re-shi mean without arrow / without feather?  without wings maybe? If it's wind, then we have without wind. regardless, felurian seems to think kvothe can't fly

> Felurian turned over my hand and examined my palm and fingers closely. “you are not a fighter,”
> she mused softly to herself. “yet you are all iron-bitten. you are a sweet **bird that cannot fly**. no bow.
> no knife. no chain.”

Though why Bast would call his master by such a discouraging name given his near worship is something of a mystery. Maybe unexplained/dropped "i" gives it a twist? If tempi and auri are any indication it might mean little. 

So again we circle a couple ideas:

* little featherless 
* little windless/airless/breathless
* little traveler
* tiny godless ~ if knowing the name of the wind makes you a god

Regardless, would seem to tie in nicely with some other theories that Kvothe is, all-unknowing to himself, a Ruach. Maybe a fallen/wingless angel?

This would also mean Bast is using an Ademic title/nickname for Kote, which might imply something about his past or parentage. Specifically, Felurian has ties to the Adem at least through the names of her love play "playing ivy" compared to the adems ketan moves e.g "crawling ivy".

random connections we can ferret out later:

* ben asking kvothe how to strike a bird down. 
* why does felurian say "no chain" that one isn't like the others. A gram? Some pictures depicted grey glad figures in the fae with chains using them like weapons.
* "Re" also refers to land. If we keep shi, as negation, it might be his name is landless? Very Ruh. Maybe that's the meaning bast likes "traveler".
* Most tinfoily we remember "re" is implied to be feminine. Switching the genders on some of your favorite legends might cause is bit of a headache and open some new doors. Or maybe he finds himself full of someone else's breath? He's blood, name and umm... Seed scattered to the four corners?
* If kvothe is Rethe in a way then its own fitting given he made an arrow catch. 

Some words Ae is in (and random musings):
*  Kraemet and Aerin, one of which might be "god". I prefer the latter and its close to Caenin. 
* Aeruh ~ air or maybe wind
*  fae, give or take an F
* chaen, can't spell seven without it
* Aerlevsedi which is Wind (as pointed out in comments)
* its also in chanvaen, is that seven again? god/ae/wind/arrow seems to have moved to vaen, maybe they have better food. 
* caenin ~ seven again? (s/c)ee ae cozie up to nin(a)? I hope he doesn't bring a rose.
* so abstract it might as well be fanfiction I present: lyr(a|e)rnal
* Aerueh ~ where you can get dark ink
* you can't spell cthaeh or maer without it. 
* if you push the letters together you get something of a whole circle rather than two broken ones.
* its at the heart of haert
* kaepcaen loves it so much it had has it twice.
* It's in every faerie story. 
* even the chaendrian can't get along without it. 


So I'll admit i didn't put a ton of time into this, thinking it most likely fruitless given how often my translation efforts went sideways in the past. But Ae seems fairly fundamental, especially with it being the difference between heart and heart. It's also two really common letters and its potential significance might be purely my or your collective imagination. I might try to write something up that's better than this in the future. With more narrative and organization.


Fun fact...

ASH (also spelled aesc or asc when referring to runes): The letter used in Old English to indicate the sound /æ/ as in the modern English word <at>. The name comes from the Old Norse rune aesc.
