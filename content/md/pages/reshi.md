We start the translation of "Reshi" with a quote from Tempi:

> “Aesh. No arrow.” ~ TMWF:625

It seems reasonable to assume Aesh means "no arrow". But how do we break it apart into its two parts: arrow and negation? Another Ademic word will give us a hint: Aethe, who founded the school and sought mastery over the bow and **arrow**. As the suffix _the_ is used elsewhere it's "Ae" that differentiates the name, and so is "Arrow". Next, Let's consider his troublesome student, Rethe, whose name conspicuously differs only by the first two letters **Re**. If Aethe is famous for his Arrow, then what might Rethe be known for? Given two birds of a feather, we should seek balance:

> She took a white feather from the arrow’s **fletching**, dipped it in her blood, and wrote four lines of poetry. ~ TWMF:757

So Re means fletching/feather/wing. For the remaining suffix "-shi", we turn back to the word "Aesh" once more, which we are now sure means "no arrow". So "sh" might be negation. Making Re-shi mean "without feather"? Maybe closer to _Wingless_. Another Fae, Felurian thinks Kvothe can't take to the skies:

> Felurian turned over my hand and examined my palm and fingers closely. “you are not a fighter,” she mused softly to herself. “yet you are all iron-bitten. you are a sweet **bird that cannot fly**. no bow. no knife. no chain.” ~ TWMF:659

See Kote move with simple perfect purpose, clutching a torn rag and moving it in slow circles on already polished mahogany. His face mask of agony, a sad look, his thoughts adrift with what the world took. Standing there like a broken god, a king without a crown, and upon his hands no rings adorn, and we believe hope is forsworn.


_We seek to ride the winds,_  
_spread our wings and fly._  
_Never looking upward,_  
_to see the strings that hold us in the sky._  

_step, twirl and play_  
_run and hide, stay and pray_  
_It means naught to the tide_  


_The hand that moves with gentle knowing,_  
_sees which way were going,_  
_It plays a simple melody, and we think ourselves free_  


_dip and wick, kick and turn._  
_Flew too high,_  
_The sun can't help but burn_  

_Listen close Son of Adam, Daughter of Eve,_  
_The stones lie, the skies deceive,_  
_Things are not as you believe_  
_The truth is yours to take, if from this dream you wish to awake_  


_Our prison needs no doors to hold us,_  
_if we never see what binds us._  
_Kote has cut the strings away,_  
_A high price to pay._  

_His story rolls over us like the endless ocean,_  
_We feel the calm, and never hear the storm that rages around us_  
_For in the eye of the hurricane there is quiet._
