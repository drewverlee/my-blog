_All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come_  
_To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,_   
_To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride_  
_On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task_  
_Ariel and all his quality._  

~ Ariel from Shakespears, the Tempest
 

## Intro

This is part of [Warrens](/pages-output/warrens) series and directly follows [Tending](/pages-output/tending). Here will be looking at translating Vorfelan Rhinata Morie.

## Weathering time and tide
 
Words are leaves, building on their predecessors, and their history forms a tree that no speaker has full mastery over. Our lungs are the wind that sets them swaying, but don't be enamored by the crown, follow their twisting path to the trunk. Harder to strike, but also to change and it's pillar doesn't end because we can't see. Beneath and about, as above so below. It builds a bridge from the "Earth to the Sky". The name of a Tak predecessor called Kaen. And is a journey that the broken one took to mend their heart by trapping its desire, an act that started a war. A war were told is long buried.

The Great Stone Road cuts the land like it was drawn in the dirt by some giant forgotten god, one climbs into the mountains. The other is blocked by a standing stone, a pillar of knowledge, the Archives. Upon it's doors is chiseled the words *Vorfelan Rhinata Morie*. 

Wil says it's close to meaning “The desire for knowledge shapes a man,”. But close is nothing to the Lethani, their is and their is not. And knowing is the difference between falling and redemption when you walk the mountain pass. And so we must calm the storm within and stop fighting the tide, see the motion the sea makes and ride the currents to the deep dark below and see how far the roots go. 


_lan_ is used in _ruhlan_, _delan_ and _vorelan_, _palan_. The last I suspect mean roughly Cealdish, the suffix _-lan_ implying _people of the_ with the prefix specifying _of what_. In this case, the _fe_ or _fea_, which means _felan_ another way of saying _faen_. 
  
The skindancer implies _Avoi_ means _want_ or possible _look_. _vor_ is used in Felurians song _tu nia vor ruhlan_. And we now know _ruhlan_ to mean people of the ruha cousin of _travelers_. I think it's safe to say that Felurian did desire wanders from time to time.

But ruh might stem from ruach and branch into _reh_ which is for seeking. Some of the Ruach did become watchers/amyr. Alternatively, Arliden said Kvothe mean "to know** and given many words end in _-the** : aethe, gilthe, elthe, skethe, etc. it's possible we can pull the word apart and k**vo**  shares an ancestry with _knowledge_.

Glammourie is the faen magic of changing how things physically are, Grammarie is changing how you feel about them, and I suggest Glammorie is both together: _shaping_.

Rhinata is the puzzle of an age. The suffix "-ata" appears in  _kreata_ and _vhenata_. I believe Reta means feminine given "skethe te retaa van" which means "lock up your sons and daugthers" and Rotens wife was named Reta. The Rhin-na was a flower and cure all. Rhin-ta is a bad thing, the chandrian. Nearly the same word the skindancer directs towards Kote. _Te Rhintae?_. I believe they made glass at the Rhinnary and so rhin/glass could turn/reflect a man.

We trace possibilities, assign, take measure and make notes ... to what end? We have been lead around the garden path and the tapestry of meaning is frayed, fraught and frustrating. What good is finding anyway? The questions are the desire, the sky's _horizon_ the goal. We had it all wrong, we stand at the entrance to the universe and admire the door.

_watch carefully daughter hare, hold quiet father fox_

_See her move from place to place._  
_Mantled in darkness._  
_Tending to the proper way_

_For she knows the cruel games names play_  
_And so often finds a gentler way._  
_Yet, for him, these rules she would betray._  

_See her feet, bare upon stones._  
_Broken mirror-glass and clean fire._  
_Bending to the breaking way._  

_set a laurel a light_  
_so too this Ash will burn,_  
_then to flesh all things return_  

_See her bear the flame._  
_A wick, a widdershins, an awakening._  
_Her desire shapes his way_
