## Holly 

I believe holly berry is a metaphor for creation. The Lady/Lyra uses it to bring
back Lanre in the form of Old Holly the warrior. For further exploration,
consult this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/krxwj0/lets_discuss_old_holly_berries_and_birth/), though it wasn't written with this in mind.

Holly is what the Sithe wear when they ride out hunting skin dancers, so we presume it has some protective powers

Bast tells us the Sithe guard the Cthaeh, and treat anyone who comes in contact
with it like a disease they need to burn out of this world. Kvothe casual walked
up to it however, so something is amiss.I like to think they allowed it.
Furthermore and that they are shooting down the butterflies. Butterflies
pollinate, which help plants reproduce, by moving the male bits to the female bits on
another plant. So is kvothe a pollinature of another sort? Felurian doesn't
think he is bitten, but she doesn't look to hard. And she is a bit of a twilight
flower, if you will excuse the expression, herself.

Holly is also features predominantly in How Old Holly came to be OH:

> Old Holly bent his boughs again, and brought a spear, its wood of living green. Its blade as bright as berry blood. This he drove into...

And has implications for our tired Inn Keeper. WMF:2:423

> The innkeeper ’s fingers fumbled clumsily, snapping the holly branch and jabbing a thorn deep into the fleshy part of his thumb. The red-haired man didn’t flinch or curse, just scowled angrily down at his hand as a bead of blood welled up, bright as a berry.
