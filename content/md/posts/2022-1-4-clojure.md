The type of software development I do is more akin to writing fantasy then
physics. The code on my page is a story I want to tell. And like how fantasy tropes repeat themselves
over and over, so to is there a rhythm to the tales I tell in code. A steady heart beat, waves of numbers, stretching across endless in text across time.

The writer rarely creates new letters outside the readers primary language, as doing so creates a large barrier to understanding. Barriers are good if they protect you, bad if they get in your way. The narrow road between them stretches between writer and reader. A dance. The writer leads, and though the reader might stumble, when the learn the harmony, they might find themselves the wiser.

Or they might reject the movements offered, and find another way to reach there goals.

When i write software I am writer and reader both. And when I work in Clojure, there is a recursive nature to this. The code i write is written in the code i read. And if you wonder how or _why_ it could be any other way, then your on the right path.

The trick to losing your way is to miss the difference between writing text and writing code. Code is meant to be processed by a computer. We know the difference between the word "apple" and "orange". We they have different letters, so does the computer. But we know how they taste, our machine friends do not. 

The machines, like us, know what we have been told. To a machine the words "User" and "Building" differ only in there letters. When you create an object or function. your not speaking to a human, your speaking to a machine. Consider this line of python code. 

User.name

If you hand that to the python interpreter. What do you think you will get back?

What about

(:name user)
