The theory is that Auri can use Greystones to travel and she does so in the SROST
to visit the Mauthen farm. Comparing the Mauthen farm to the location she visits is covered [How to
get to Newarre ](/posts-output/2021-1-23-how-toget-to-newarre) and what she does there
is covered in [Warren Widdershins Ways and
Woes](/posts-output/2021-1-15-bone-and-crystal). 

Here we will just be discussing Greystones. First will quickly cover that Auri could use one to visit the Mauthen farm quickly
(in mortal time), and then will discuss the larger topic of Greystones in general. If this seems backwards to you, then by all means
do them in reverse.

## Auri goes to Mauthen farm

southwest, barely two miles away,

Concisely, Auri would have taken the Greystone near the Omethi bridge, traveled
through the Fae, and come out the one around 2 miles north east of Trebon, near
the Mauthen farm. Likely the journey took under an hour from when she leaves the
Underthing tell when she ends up in the Mauthen Farm. I don't think we can
figure out how much distance or time she had to cover in the Fae.

Auri would have taken the Greystone that Kvothe, Wil and Sim use as a place to
sober up at, on there way back from Imre to the University, right before the
bridge. MWF:36:272

> Simmon and I muffled our laughter, and Wilem led us through the trees to a little clearing not fifty
> feet from the foot of the bridge. To my surprise a tall greystone stood at the middle of it, pointing
> skyward.

From there, she would travel through the Fae, where time moves slower, and come out at the Greystone Kvothe
and Denna dramatically use to take shelter from the draccus. NOTW:74:569:

> I grabbed hold of her arm and ran toward the opposite side of the hill. Denna kept up with me at first, then planted her feet when she saw where I was headed. “Don’t be stupid,” she hissed. “We’ll break our necks if we run down that in the dark.” She cast around wildly, then looked up at the nearby greystones. “Get me up there and I’ll haul you up after.”

Clever Pat even calls this chapter "Waystone". Coming out of this Greystone it
would be a short trip for Auri to get the Mauthen farm. Which she describes as a
Graveyrad in SROST.

Lets cover a similar example of using the Greystones for travel, when Kvothe visits Felurian and enters and leaves the Fae.

## there and back again

We have first hand experience that the Greystones are indeed used as gateways
between the fae and the mortal realm. When Kvothe follows Felurian past one on
his way into the Fae. WMF:99:633:

> Felurian ahead of me. Into the scrub. I dimly remember trees, the smell of earth, the grey of
> moonlit stone. She laughs. She dodges, dances, pulls ahead.

Where they both make a bit of music, and at the _very_ least 3 weeks later, he exists, in a different place:

> She led me through the forest for hours until we came to a pair of tall greystones. She drew up the
> hood of my shaed and bid me close my eyes. Then she led me in a brief circle and I felt a subtle
> change in the air. When I opened my eyes I could tell this forest was not the same one I had been
> walking through a moment before. The strange tension in the air was gone. This was the mortal
> world.

I say _at least 3 weeks_, based on the changes in his beard that Dedan notes when they meet again. 
WMF:107:700:

> Before I could say anything Dedan burst in. “What about his beard then? When he ran off three
> nights ago his face was smooth as a baby’s ass.”

Anything worthy of even remotely calling a "beard" would take 2 weeks, more
typically 2-4 months. I suspect much Kvothe stayed much longer, but even this
modest guess makes Auri's trip plausible.

Finally, we also have visual confirmation that Auri has visited the fae before:

Thanks for reading!

The sections below are a WIP.

## Greystones  (WIP)

I'm trying to map and categorize the Greystones.

Will use a table and some narrative to better our understanding of waystones. First we have to choose what to categorize:

* Where: so we have some idea how can get around. TODO map
* Standing vs Laying: TODO
* Type: greystone, drawstone, etc...
* old road: because ardlins song mentions it
* The last category will be "Rawness" because bast says he prefers these places. (this was mattys good idea)

Bast explaining:

> “Most of the Fae don’t come to this
> world. They don’t like it. It rubs all rough against them, like wearing a burlap
> shirt. But when they do come, they like some places better than others. They
> like wild places. Secret places. Strange places. There are many types of fae,
> many courts and houses. And all of them are ruled according to their own desires
> …” Bast continued in a tone of soft conspiracy. “But something that appeals to
> all the fae are places with connections
> 
> to the raw, true things that shape the world. Places that are touched with
> fire and stone. Places that are close to water and air. When all four come
> together …”

So here is our table:



| Where                      | Standing/laying       | High/low               | Type                   | Rawness                |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Newarre                    | Titled                | Low                    | Greystone              | TODO                   |
| Trope Stop                 | Standing              | Level                  | TODO                   | TODO                   |
| Post Trope Death           | Laying                | Level                  | TODO                   | TODO                   |

For another take on waystones I suggest everything by mattytangle. Though, you should try your hand at it first before consulting his works


## rights

## TODO / notes / etc...

* discuss time and location changes in fae here or something else. e.g

Locations are bound to times:

> Since I had left my mercenary companions I had slept perhaps a dozen times.
> Despite this, the sky above Felurian’s pavilion remained the deep purpling blue
> of summer dusk and showed no signs of changing. I had only the roughest guess as
> to how long I had been in the Fae. More importantly, I had no idea how much time
> might have been passing in the mortal world. Stories are full of boys who fall
> asleep in faerie circles only to wake as old men. Young girls wander into the
> woods and return years later, looking no older and claiming only minutes have
> passed. For all I knew, years could pass each time I slept in Felurian’s arms. I
> could return to find a century had passed, or no time at all.

* Ctheah cant sleep because no night?

another example of moving in the fae

> As we walked the forest grew darker. At first I thought it was simply the branches of the trees
> arching over our heads. Then I realized the truth. Above us, the twilight sky was slowly growing
