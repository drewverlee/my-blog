## Intro 

This is part of [warrens series](/posts-output/2021-1-15-bone-and-crystal) and follows [Turnings](/posts-output/2021-1-26-turnings). 

The goal here is to discover the meaning of our red hair innkeeper's new name, "Kote". This has been discussed nearly to death, yet I haven't seen what I consider the correct translation. I'm going to scour the books and make guesses to be exhaustive. However, in the end, we will find ourselves in the heart of a maze with no clear answer, and it _will be a disaster_.

## Looking at the fit

The word "Kote" is used twice by Kilvin, and so it's from there our journey should start.

> "**Kist**, crayle, en kote," he swore furiously. He threw down the metal tube where it rang sharply
> against the stone floor. “Kraemet brevetan Aerin!”

Kvothe's Siaru isn't perfect, but he thinks Kilvin sad "Shit in God's beard". The comma at the end of the first phrase might indicate one continuous expression from Kilvin. [A usage Grammarly describes as Commaa between direct quote and attribute tag](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/comma/). We get examples right away in NOTW e.g 

> "Hush now, you'll get all the answers before the end," Jake said. "Just let him tell it."

> "No need for all that, Jake," Graham said. "Boy's just curious. Drink your drink."

Furthermore, Kvothe might only be pulling out words randomly and piecing them together. This means it's likely our set of words ranged the whole  7 words Kilvin uses to ~make you love him~~. This is going to be challenging and involve some guesswork.

Kote is used again by Kilvin when talking to Kvothe:

> "I am," he said cheerfully. "Do you know the saying 'Chan Vaen edan **Kote**'?"

> I tried to puzzle it out. "Seven years ... I don't know **Kote**."

> "'**Expect disaster** every seven years,'" he said. "It is an old saying, and true enough. This has been two years overdue." He gestured to the wreckage of his shop with a bandaged hand. "And now that it has come, it proves a mild disaster. My lamps were undamaged. No one was killed. Of all the small injuries, mine were the worst, as it should be."

We have to assume Kilvin would have corrected Kote if he got the first part wrong. So we can safely narrow down the options.

* kote = expect | disaster | every
* edan = expect | disaster | every

Will have to dive into other phrases and parts of the language to make sense of this. Kist is used several times and always as part of a curse.

> "**Kist**, crayle, en kote," he swore furiously. He threw down the metal tube where it rang sharply.

> "**Kist** and crayle," I said, my own heart racing. "What's the matter?"

> **Kist**," he swore, then headed back outside, the door banging behind him.

> the word Furtherence. Furtherance. **Kist**. You know what I mean.

> ever heard from her before. "**Kist** and crayle, I hate that Goddamn play. Modegan faerie-story trash.

If we had to choose a word from our set {shit, in, god, beard}, we should lean towards "shit". Given Kist and Crayle are only ever used in curses, it would be nice to check to make sure nothing pops out as close:

* blackened body of god
* charred body of god
* tehlu's tits and teeth
* tiny gods -Auri?
* shit in god's beard -Kilvin (translated)
* lord and lady
* "Blood, bracken, and bone" 
* Blackened, sodding damn  - Kvothe 
* "Tehlu anyway"
* God's grey ashes, (Sim)
* "Mother of God" - Graham speaking to Carter
* Mothers milk
* shit and onions
* Tehlu and his great glowing penis can piss all over me 
* Tehlu hold and overroll us.

Any of these words might play a role, but nothing contains "beard", and so we don't have a potential direct link. "Kist and crayle" might translate to  "Shit and Onions" given we just suggested that "shit" substitute well for "Kist" in all uses. Crayle never appears on it's own, and its similarity to scrael is exciting, but nothing seems to come of it. Similar "en" is used twice by itself "En Temerant Voistra" making it a candidate for "the" or "In". Temerant sounds shinny, and "Voistra" sounds reminiscent of "avoi" which our skin-danced friend seems to use  for "look/see" or maybe "want". So "En Temerant voistra" might be "A look into Temerant". "en" also gets a brief mention by our pig farmer friend as a substitute for "in" in the phrase "wool en tae mouth..." So if we had to bet, en=in.

It would be nice to take a guess at what "Kraemet brevetan Aerin" means. AE appears in several critical words and is worth discussing on it's own. Here is a quick and flippant break down of "AEs" role in some words:

* Kraemet and Aerin, one of which might be "god".
* Aeruh ~ air or maybe wind
* Aethe ~ the Arrow? The wind?
* fae, give or take an F
* chaen, can't spell seven without it
* Aerlevsedi which is Wind (as pointed out in comments)
* its also in chanvaen, is that seven again? god/ae/wind/arrow seems to have moved to vaen, maybe they have better food. 
* caenin ~ seven again? (s/c)ee ae cozie up to nin(a)? I hope he doesn't bring a rose.
* so abstract it might as well be fanfiction I present: lyr(a|e)rnal
* Aerueh ~ where you can get dark ink
* you can't spell cthaeh or maer without it. 
* if you push the letters together, you get something of a whole circle rather than two broken ones.
* its at the heart of haert
* kaepcaen loves it so much it had has it twice.
* It's in every faerie story. 
* even the chaendrian can't get along without it. 

Gran might have a good idea about how to think about AE. _Arrowroot hain't a
palliative of any sort. It's just good at carrying around what works."_. If i
was looking for God, I would lean towards one of these two "Kraemet" or "Aerin".
Let's start with Kraemet:

> "**Kraem**. No. Not like this." Kilvin growled out a couple words and pounded his fist on the table, each thump as his hand came down was accompanied by a staccato burst of reddish light that welled up from his hand. "No sympathy. I do not want an ever-glowng lamp. I want an ever-burning one." He looked at me again showing his teeth, as if he were going to eat me.

> "Only nobility," Wilem said. "**Kraemlish** bastards with no business having their study here. I think they stoke up high tuitions just so they can complain."

> "**Kraem** no," Wilem said. "He can't go to the Medica. They will be asking to see if anyone is hurt."

> against the stone floor. “**Kraemet** brevetan Aerin!”

> Wil looked down at the tabletop. "**Kraem,**" he said. "It makes sense. 

If your from Yll  your "yllish" so "-lish" might be a suffix meaning "people of". This would make our curses:

* "Godless bastards". 
* "god no"
* "god"
* "god no"

All which work rather well. Though I suppos "shit" and "shitless" do to, but that's firmly in second place.

It's possible "K-" is a form of negation or negative. The short argument for this comes from this exchange:


> I felt Master Elodin look at me. Actually felt it, I suppressed a shiver. "So-heketh ka Siaru krema'teth tu?" he asked. How well do you speak Siaru?

> “Rieusa, ta **krelar** deala tu.” Not very well, thank you.

Given re'lar means "speaker", it seems to be that we just slapped a k on it to negate it. And so Kraem could be the negated/evil/bad god. But I don't think we need to go down that road, other than to say it uses suggest it could be god. 


At best, I can say that Brevetan might share a root with our white-bearded Tak player Bredan. The suffix "-tan" is used in "quetentan~question" and "ketan" both are curious words, but neither leads me to any great insight. It could be used to modify the noun, so cutting it off might leave us close to the core, which is all we need here. "breve". It sort of looks like it might want to be beard. Or even better [beaver](https://www.etymonline.com/word/beaver), which could have been transferred from the early meaning "a bearded man" before it got it's more popular meaning. 

Lot's of potential fun can be had with "Aerin" It has our isolated AE + rin. If AE is the wind, then we should be considered anything close to rin|rhintae|rhinta|rhin|rhinna|rhinata|rainbows ok.. the last one is silly. _Why make a child terrified of **rainbows**?_. 

Like drawing attention to how its only a_v_ away from Verian, which is tiny red flower. One which kvothe draws attention to when discussing Verainia greyflocks, whose name he pairs down to "nina". In a Spanish context, Niña means "child". It's often a female name. It's also a short hop to  NIN (feature on official notw decks), in Sumerian also means "queen", "lady" "lord". Gods above, lets not even mention that it's occurrence in the name of Ninsun, (formal meaning "sun"), the mother of Gilgamesh, especially in the _flood myth_. 

_Frantically tosses shuffles papers about until he finds one on which half of the words are upside down_

Ah yes, "Nina" in a Russian context it is a shortening of Annina, diminutive of Greek Anna, which is short for Annabelle, Kvothe first guess at the name for Denna's patron. I'm sure Kvothe could think of one sunny little girl in her life, but we can't go around connecting her to Denna's Patron because of some hackneyed romp through etymonline.com Madness. What's next, suggesting she is a god?

_Listen, strange women diving into ponds distributing bones and crystals is no basis for a system of creation. Supreme theoretical insight is gained by a comparison of the legends, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony._

_You can't expect to wield supreme magical power just 'cause some watery tart gave you a key, kiss and candle._

_I mean, if I went around saying there were nine chandrian, simply because a moistened modor put a gian-t_emberant_ [**iridium**](https://www.etymonline.com/word/iridium#etymonline_v_12225) gear on a _chair_, they'd put me away!_

I'm sorry, what were we doing again? Oh, yes. 

> “Kraemet brevetan Aerin!”

So like Encansis Tehlu, we have two gods and potentially a brevetan|barber|beard in the middle, trying to cut a beard. Or shit in it. Not much help  at all in translating Kote, but maybe we had our eyes opened to some new ideas.

Edan makes an appearance is a sentence that's even harder to translate:

> "Tetalia tu Kiaure edan A'siath," he said in Siaru, clapping Wilem on the shoulder as he walked out from behind the desk. "Vorelan tua tetam."

And while I see some interesting words in there, I'll spare you the details and say I can't translate it well enough to raise my confidence on the issue at hand, and were already well over budget in terms of holding your attention. 

One phrase that wouldn't seem relevant at first glance but is likely the fulcrum to this mystery is

> “Tuan volgen oketh ama.” I said, using one of my favorite Siaru idioms. It meant 'don't let it make you crazy' but it translated literally as: 'don't put a spoon in your eye over it.'

I'll claim two of these words are easy to identify. "Tuan" ~ "your/you/dont you". Sharing a root "tu" as used in "tu ketha" ~ "are you coal". The other is Volgen
which longer and so likely fits to spoon. This leaves us with "oketh" and "ama" one of which needs to function as "in eye/in one eye". This ends
up being quite a challenge. _ama_ would be a good candidate for eye give three letters. It seems to share a root with some faen words we learn, amouen:

> > She looked down at me, her expression proud and regal as a queen.
> "**amouen**," she said, spreading the fingers of one hand and making a
> deliberate gesture. "this we call the hushed hart. an easy lesson to begin,
> and one I expect you will enjoy."

and 

> Felurian smiled indulgently. "you are my precious newborn lamb. look! there
> hangs a cloud as well! **amouen!** dance for joy!" She laughed.

We can only speculate if Rothfuss intended these to share a root. But If we had to pick based on context, it leans "look" but is shares more letters with "sound/listen" or maybe a child of both meaning _pay attention_.

Additionaly, "oketh ama" could together be "one dark eye" the pune now clearly a reference to Skarpis story about Selitos. "Keth" itself seems to share a root or similarity with "dark/black/coal" considering "to Ketha" being close to "are you coal". The Tinker tells us that "ket-selem" would be "first-night" and "keth-selhan" would be "one sock" the root "ket" seems to be first, which would seem to fit with _oketh_ being one and _ama_ being eye.

The reason for considering these words is because _Kote_ isn't to far from _keth_. We were left with a bit of a choice. Is oketh _eye_ or is ama? I'm leading you down this road because I think this confusion is planned. This is the deeper mystery beyond considering if Kote's life was a disaster. Is he a hero, the "one" may be a God? And more importantly, what does it mean to be a god. They're all around us, why comment on one more 
when he can't even seem to fight off one man. 

Or maybe the is closeness to _keth_ hints he was the villain of coal~ash all along? Words are pale shadows of names and Bast hints someone truly powerful could take a shadow and... what? Make of it a curse? Use it to keep them safe? I don't believe shadows make us who we are; I think what we choose to hide in them does. So here we are in darkness, turned and turned about in a maze of meaning. Old ways are best, the clearest common road was a **disaster**, but at least it was familiar. 

But like our Inn Keeper, we have saved our fire for the darkest hour, when it will burn the brightest. And our sleeping mind will do more a moment than a decade of spilled black ink could not...

_Listen, look and see_
_What a puppet says to thee_
_Do you know what you have been, what you are not, and what you will be?_

_Bast sees a Kote and thinks disaster,_
_but he underestimates his master._
_The young act with reckless defiance._
_A Specere seeks the haert of silence._

_Specere/"see" -> spectar/"to look" -> exspectar/"look out for" -> expect/"defer action"_

That isn't the end of the song, or Kotes... not by half. 

## Translations

I suspect the translation is as follows. "Kist, crayle, en kote," is akin to "Shit and onions in my eye." or simply put, "I can't see shit". recall that the lighting had changed in the Fishery and possible it was throwing the Masters keen eye off:

> I hoped the change in light was due to a new lamp.
> Kilvin's mood was always foul when one of his lamps went unexpectedly dark.
> Scanning the rafters, I didn't see any dark lamps. It took me a long moment to realize the strange
> quality of the light was due to actual sunlight slanting in through the low windows on the eastern wall.
> Normally I didn't come to work until later in the day.

Or maybe his goggles were fogged:

> "Kist, crayle, en kote," he swore furiously. He threw down the metal tube where it rang sharply
> against the stone floor. “Kraemet brevetan Aerin!”
> I fought down the sudden urge to laugh. My Siaru wasn't perfect, but I was fairly certain Kilvin had
> said, Shit in God's beard.
> The bearlike master stood for a long moment, looking down at the ruined glass on the floor. Then
> he let out a long, irritated breath through his nose, pulled off his **goggles**, and turned to look at me.

Meanwhile, but itself:

> “Kraemet brevetan Aerin!”

It might be "blackened beard of god". Though the whole thing might functionally come across as "I cant see through the blackened beard of god". Though putting Aturn prudishness aside, if brevetan did lean towards the slang term for beaver, there might be some far-reaching implication. 

But regardless, Seer. Kote didn't _v_e_h_ / submit, he rolled the dice. And all of creation is tumbling with it now. 

## Epilogue
