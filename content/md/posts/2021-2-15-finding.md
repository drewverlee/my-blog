_What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow_
<br>
_Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,_
<br>
_You cannot say, or guess, for you know only_
<br>
_A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,_
<br>
_And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,_
<br>
_And the dry stone no sound of water. Only_
<br>
_There is shadow under this red rock,_
<br>
_(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),_
<br>
_And I will show you something different from either_
<br>
_Your shadow at morning striding behind you_
<br>
_Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;_
<br>
_I will show you fear in a handful of dust._


_-- From The Waste Land by T.S Eliot_

## Intro

This story is part of a bigger one called [Warrens Widdershins Ways and
Woes](/post-outputs/2021-1-15-bone-and-crystal), you should have worked your way
through it and arrived her from my last piece [Painful Treasures of the Mind](/posts-output/2021-2-11-betrayed). This part will cover the Auri's journey to
Wains, where she notices something is amiss, and finds an Amyr doll under the
couch. Then will unwind the journey from another perspective. Our last looks
into Auri haven't been comforting, we turned events and then turned them back
again until the pieces started to fit and the words the story tells are not a
children's story. Were left hollow and betrayed, we want desperately to find a
light that will turn these shadows into simple solid things. Ahead we see the
blue-green light of foxen playing off the curved burrow of the underthings
below. It flickers on iron pipes and murky waters. We follow...

## A hand reaching

We catch up with Auri as she visits Wains, discovers a new room, and notices
something isn't quite proper.

> Auri brushed off her hands, swung the door
> open, and stepped lightly into Wains. The hallway was wide enough to drive a
> wagon through. High-ceilinged and long enough that Foxen’s light could barely
> reach the tangle of debris that blocked the far end. Above her, bluewhite light
> scattered off a crystal chandelier. Dark wood paneling hugged the lower portion
> of the walls, but above that was ornate plasterwork. There were broad frescoes
> decorating the ceiling. Women in gauze lounged about, whispering and rubbing oil on each other. Men
> frolicked about in the water, flapping around ridiculously in their absolute
> altogether. 
> 
> -- SROST:1:35

Note the bluewhite light, a chandelier, dark wood, a picture of women and men frolicking. 
She finds the Crystal here, the one we discussed so long ago, but lets skip over that for now.

She decides to open the 9th door in Wains. She calls the new place it opens into a sitting
room, it has a velvet chair, a low wooden table, etc..

>  A tall velvet chair. A low wooden table. A plush couch on a plush carpet. In
> the corner was a tiny cart filled with glasses and bottles. They were very
> dignified. 
>
> -- SROST:1:27

she tells us something is wrong withe the room.

> There was something wrong with the room.

She looks around, she mentions the carpet in the room is like moss:

> plush of the carpet was sweet beneath her feet, like moss, 

She sees a tiny whiteness under the couch:

> and when she bent down to run her fingers over the hush of it, she glimpsed a tiny whiteness
> underneath the couch.

She reaches for it:

> She reached deep into the shadows with a small white hand,
> having to stretch a bit before her fingers caught it. Smooth and cool. It was a tiny figurine carved
> from a piece of pale, retiring stone. A small soldier with clever lines to show
> his hauberk and his shield.

Its they Amyr that was featured discussed in the Warrens Post. But it wasn't the issue with the room:

> It didn’t belong here, but it wasn’t wrong. Or
> rather, it wasn’t what was wrong with the room. The poor thing was simply lost.
> Auri smiled and put the doll in her pocket with the crystal. It was then she
> felt a tiny bump beneath one foot. 

She takes a long look at a bone button, but it's right where it should be:

> She pulled up the edge of the carpet, rolled
> it back, and found a small bone button underneath. Auri eyed it for a long
> moment before giving it an understanding smile. That wasn’t it either. The
> button was just as it should

That's it! That's a couple minutes in Auri's day. Nothing special. Nothing was
nothing else. Nothing was anything it shouldn’t be. 

_Oh, how I wish that were true._

You grip the world in our hands and we turn it against itself for a third time,
widdershins, the breaking way. The ground thrums off in the distance as if
struck by a giant hammer and a great wind strikes you. The earth writhes and
reaches upward like a giant hand in your grasp. You're left standing on cliff's
edge. You step off the ledge and into the black below and your falling... the air
rolls over you, pulling cold at your flesh, you see nothing below you, but you
feel the weight of the sky bearing down.

_Without love, the fire_
<br>
_Without joy, the salt_
<br>
_Without wind, the fall_

## As Below so Above: A shadow reaching

Were going to retrace our steps. 

<img src="/img/auri-steps.png" height="300px" width="300px">


Only now instead of looking will be _seeing_.
When Auri enters Wains, were presented with a Fresco painting on the ceiling. 

> There were broad frescoes decorating the ceiling.

A fresco is a technique of mural painting, commonly used in cathedrals. You have
likely seen part of the "Creation of Adam" by Michelangelo, but take a look at
the full piece on the ceiling of the [Sistine Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel_ceiling#/media/File:CAPPELLA_SISTINA_Ceiling.jpg), as you
might expect, there is nudity. I also recommend _The Fall and Expulsion from
Paradise_. Here is just the _upper_ part:

<img src="/img/fall-from-creation-top.png" height="200px" width="500px">


The one Auri sees has women and men scantily clothed or naked, lounging and frolicking about:

> Women in gauze lounged about, whispering and rubbing oil on each other. Men
> frolicked about in the water, flapping around ridiculously in their absolute
> altogether.

This is the fae, those she sees are faen in there revelry:

<img src="/img/faerev.jpg" height="300px" width="300px">


I'm not saying she is seeing a painting of the Fae. I'm saying,
she is _seeing the Fae_. The dark wood paneling are trees, the men and women are
Fae and mortal guest unabashedly enjoying each others company.

Let me draw your attention to some other aspects of "The sitting room" as Auri calls
it. It has a chandelier with bluewhite light reflecting on a crystal chandelier.

> Above her, bluewhite light scattered off a crystal chandelier. **Dark wood** paneling 

Much like the sky above our young hero Kvothe, miles, days and worlds away in the Fae. 

> I was reminded of a vast, empty **cathedral** swathed in sooty **velvet**.
> 
> -- TMWF:100:661


Kvothe is reminded of a Cathedral, here is an arch from the [Durham Cathedral](https://www.durhamworldheritagesite.com/learn/architecture/cathedral/architectural-importance):

<img src="/img/cathedral-arch.jpg" height="220px" width="525px">

And the imagery were given in SROST:

<img src="/img/auri-arch.png" height="300px" width="450px">


The Chandelier's bluewhite light, reflected on his eyes:

> ...the last hint of purple was gone, leaving the sky a perfect **velvet** black, flecked with **unfamiliar stars**.

The carpet moss beneath Auri's toes:

> plush of the carpet was sweet beneath her feet, like **moss**,

it's pleasant touch one Felurian knows:

> So I followed, naked and unprepared. Felurian struck out at a good pace, the **moss** muffling the
> sound of our bare feet.

Now, like Kvothe we travel naked and unprepared, and with mounting trepidation, for
on the edges of our memory we know what comes next. It reaches from the dark
corners of our mind, the air draws tight in our throats...

<img src="/img/darkforest.jpg" height="600px" width="400px">

Kvothe knows neither the names of the stars, or the secrets they hold. He sees
the surface and can't fathom the depths bellow, and so he makes a foolish show:

> Thinking myself clever, I made a sympathetic binding for **light** and held my hand
> above my head as if it were a torch. I was more than slightly proud of this, as the motion-to-light
> binding is rather difficult without a piece of metal to use as a focus.
> Light swelled and I caught a moment’s glimpse of our surroundings. **Dark trunks** of trees rose like
> massive **pillars** as far as the eye could see. There were no low-hanging branches, no undergrowth, no
> grass. Only dark **moss** underfoot and the **arch** of dark branches overhead. I was reminded of a vast,
> empty **cathedral** swathed in sooty **velvet**.

Felurian heard the deep tremble and so she makes a hasty gamble, two hearts beat as one...

> “ciar nalias!” Felurian snapped.

> An instant later Felurian leapt at me and bore me to the ground, her lithe, naked body pressed against mine.

For though the stars seem tiny from afar...

> and when she bent down to run her fingers over the hush of it, she glimpsed a **tiny whiteness** 
> underneath the couch.

they too can scar...

> She was full of **broken glass** and burrs. She was weary and disappointed with all of everything.

And you would not want to meet them as they truly are...

> She reached deep into the shadows with a small white hand,
> having to stretch a bit before her fingers caught it. 

so stay small as selas, still as stone...

> There was a soft sound of movement above us, as if someone was folding a huge piece of **velvet**
> around a piece of **broken glass**. Saying that I realize it makes no sense, but still, that is the best way I
> can describe the sound. It was a soft noise, the half-heard sound of deliberate movement. I cannot tell
> you why it made me think of something terrible and sharp, but it did. My forehead prickled with
> sweat, and I was filled with a sudden pure and breathless terror.

And pray they leave you alone.

> She pulled up the edge of the carpet, rolled
> it back, and found a small bone button underneath. Auri eyed it for a long
> moment before giving it an understanding smile. That wasn’t it either. The
> button was just as it should

> A languid moment passed, then she laughed, her body shaking with it. It was
> wild and delighted, as if she had just played the most marvelous joke.

## Epilogue

You came to this world seeking deep magic, things to help you imagine what might
be and to lose yourself in. Even in fantasy, we like our demons far away, quests
we can conquer and return safely to our soft beds. But what do the shadows want?
What is their need song and story? Huddled all alone, under all of everything,
broken and beautiful, what do the shadows dream of?

## Dreams

<img src="/img/blue-flame-art.jpg" height="500px" width="325px">

Your walking through a forest, the grass is cool under your bare feet. The dark
trunks reach far above, forming a scattered canopy. The moon gives enough light
to see a gentle stream far off and a stone inn, across it. Wil, just ahead, stops
and finally breaks the silence. He seems sad; Sim is nowhere to be seen. His
dark eyes find ours, and he speaks. You listen with half an ear as you bend to
inspect three perfect pinecones in a row. You give a slight chuckle. Then your
brows furrow... You take a moment and respond, sure you misheard him.

   _"When your wives are angry, you sleep _in_ the fire?"_

You turn to look up at him quizzically.

But he is gone; instead, Penthe gives you a pleasant kiss on the cheek. 

   _"no, no.. "_ she bats at you playful, then here eyes go sudden serious, 

   _"A man plays no role in it."_  her eyes a twilight blue... 

You know she is wrong. You are Kvothe, trained at the Medica. She cuts your
thoughts off by clasping your hands inside hers and bringing her head down to
whisper between the secret space the entangled fingers make.

  _"A man must give a woman fire if he wants to sleep"_ ... her lids flicker like
butterflies, and her eyes are deep pools you could drown in. You feel a pleasant
heat start to rise. To offset it, you stare intently at her hands. But they burst apart as 
Celean makes Sun Rising from a Cloud. 

  _"I am Celean, and I will learn all the secret ways!"_ She is dancing backward. Behind her looms the sword tree, only
now the leaves are cut-tail glass, and they no reflect no light from the day's sun. You know you can't reach her in time,
you lunge anyway, you grasp her hands.. only to find their clutching Dennas.

You're near the Greystone with her once more. The winter fills your lungs and cuts deep into your blood.

  _I stopped breathing for two minutes and died._ She doesn't speak the words.
There written on her arms, her chest, and across her face in black ink.

You both hang above the Greystone in the open air. You firmly
perched on the wind, her slipping from your grasp, to fall into its open door. 
Your muscles ache. If you only had rope, wine, or time to explain.

She looks through your eyes. She knows you will let her go. She doesn't blame
you, there isn't much of her left and, she has betrayed you.

You tighten, tense, a finger slips. If only could make a binding with your
blood, but no, you are bloodless, a hallow bell, and when the wind strikes you
there is no sound. 

_You do not let go._

You scream, and the mountains tear themselves apart-- your both falling. Your
hands bound as one. Auri holds you tightly as the darkness reaches to take you.

_"It's okay"_ She says softly. _"I'm here. You're safe."_

The Draccus roars, and its blue flame consumes you both.

You are alone once more, only wood and stream and stone. You see flames lick at
trees off to the south, hear their cries for help, and the sound of true copper
rings out as it strides upon the land.

Your legs buckle and your knees sear with pain. A single wretched grasp escapes
your lips, then another... your tears are hot blood upon the ground.


This _dreams_ sequence is my own sleeping mind at play. Find in it what you will.
