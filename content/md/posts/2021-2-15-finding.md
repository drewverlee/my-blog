_What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow_
<br>
_Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,_
<br>
_You cannot say, or guess, for you know only_
<br>
_A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,_
<br>
_And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,_
<br>
_And the dry stone no sound of water. Only_
<br>
_There is shadow under this red rock,_
<br>
_(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),_
<br>
_And I will show you something different from either_
<br>
_Your shadow at morning striding behind you_
<br>
_Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;_
<br>
_I will show you fear in a handful of dust._


_-- From The Waste Land by T.S Eliot_

## Intro

This story is part of a bigger one called [Warrens Widdershins Ways and
Woes](/post-outputs/2021-1-15-bone-and-crystal), you should have worked your way
through it and arrived her from my last piece ["To tell you the
truth"](/posts-output/2021-2-11-betrayed). This will cover the Auri's journey to
Wains, where she notices something is amiss, and finds an Amyr doll under the
couch. Then will unwind the journey from another perspective. Our last looks
into Auri haven't been comforting, we turned events and then turned them back
again until the pieces started to fit and the words the story tells are not a
children's story. Were left hollow and betrayed, we want desperately to find a
light that will turn these shadows into simple solid things. Ahead we see the
blue-green light of foxen playing off the curved burrow of the underthings
below. It flickers on iron pipes and murky waters. We follow...

## A hand reaching

We pick up Auri's journey as she visits Wains, discovers a new room, and notices
something isn't quite proper. Lets let her describe Wains.

> Auri brushed off her hands, swung the door
> open, and stepped lightly into Wains. The hallway was wide enough to drive a
> wagon through. High-ceilinged and long enough that Foxen’s light could barely
> reach the tangle of debris that blocked the far end. Above her, bluewhite light
> scattered off a crystal chandelier. Dark wood paneling hugged the lower portion
> of the walls, but above that was ornate plasterwork. There were broad frescoes
> decorating the ceiling. Women in gauze lounged about, whispering and rubbing oil on each other. Men
> frolicked about in the water, flapping around ridiculously in their absolute
> altogether. 
> 
> -- SROST:1:35

Note the bluewhite light, a chandelier, dark wood, a picture of women and men frolicking. 
She finds the Crystal here, the one we discussed so long ago, but lets skip over that for now.

She decides to open the 9th door in Wains. She calls the new place it opens into a sitting
room, it has a velvet chair, a low wooden table, etc..

>  A tall velvet chair. A low wooden table. A plush couch on a plush carpet. In
> the corner was a tiny cart filled with glasses and bottles. They were very
> dignified. 
>
> -- SROST:1:27

she tells us something is wrong withe the room.

> There was something wrong with the room.

She looks around, she mentions the carpet in the room is like moss:

> plush of the carpet was sweet beneath her feet, like moss, 

She sees a tiny whiteness under the couch:

> and when she bent down to run her fingers over the hush of it, she glimpsed a tiny whiteness
> underneath the couch.

She reaches for it:

> She reached deep into the shadows with a small white hand,
> having to stretch a bit before her fingers caught it. Smooth and cool. It was a tiny figurine carved
> from a piece of pale, retiring stone. A small soldier with clever lines to show
> his hauberk and his shield.

Its they Amyr that was featured discussed in the Warrens Post. But it wasn't the issue with the room:

> It didn’t belong here, but it wasn’t wrong. Or
> rather, it wasn’t what was wrong with the room. The poor thing was simply lost.
> Auri smiled and put the doll in her pocket with the crystal. It was then she
> felt a tiny bump beneath one foot. 

She takes a long look at a bone button, but it's right where it should be:

> She pulled up the edge of the carpet, rolled
> it back, and found a small bone button underneath. Auri eyed it for a long
> moment before giving it an understanding smile. That wasn’t it either. The
> button was just as it should

That's it! That's a couple minutes in Auri's day. Nothing was nothing else. Nothing was anything
it shouldn’t be.

You grip the world in our hands and we turn it against itself for a third time.
Widdershins, the breaking way. The sky is twlight and sunset at war. The
mountains tear, writhe and reach up to the heavens. You're left stand on cliff's
edge. You step off the ledge and into the grey below and your falling... the air
rolls over you, pulling cold at your flesh, you see nothing below you, but you feel
the weight of the sky bearing down.

_Without love, the fire_
<br>
_Without joy, the salt_
<br>
_Without wind, the fall_

## As Below so Above: A shadow reaching

Were going to back over the same path with just took with Auri. Only now instead of looking will be _seeing_.
When Auri enters Wains, were presented with a Fresco painting on the ceiling. 

> There were broad frescoes decorating the ceiling.

A fresco is a technique of mural painting, commonly used in cathedrals. You have
likely seen part of the "Creation of Adem" by Michelangelo, but take a look at
the full piece on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. It's worth a moment of our time here:

<img src="/img/chapelle.jpeg" height="400px" width="500px">

The one Auri sees women and men scantily clothed or naked lounging and frolicking:

<img src="/img/faerev.jpg" height="300px" width="300px">

> Women in gauze lounged about, whispering and rubbing oil on each other. Men
> frolicked about in the water, flapping around ridiculously in their absolute
> altogether.

This _is_ the fae. I'm not saying she is seeing painting of the Fae. I'm saying,
she is _seeing the Fae_. The dark wood paneling are trees, the men and women are
Fae and mortal guest unabashedly enjoying each others company.

Let me draw attention to some other aspects of "The sitting room" as Auri calls
it. It has a chandelier with bluewhite light scattered off a Crystal chandelier.

> Above her, bluewhite light scattered off a crystal chandelier. Dark wood paneling 

Much like the sky above our young hero Kvothe, miles, days and worlds away in the Fae. TMWF:100:

> I was reminded of a vast, empty cathedral swathed in sooty velvet.

The roof above Auri just as he describes it. 

<img src="/img/auricathedral.png" height="500px" width="300px">

The Chandelier's bluewhite light, reflected on his eyes:

> ...the last hint of purple was gone, leaving the sky a perfect velvet black, flecked with unfamiliar stars.

The carpet moss beneath Auri's toes:

> plush of the carpet was sweet beneath her feet, like moss,

it's pleasant touch one Felurian knows:

> So I followed, naked and unprepared. Felurian struck out at a good pace, the moss muffling the
> sound of our bare feet.

Now, like Kvothe we travel naked and unprepared, and with some trepidation, for
on the edges of our memory we know what comes next. It reaches from the dark
corners of our mind, the air draws tight in our throats...

<img src="/img/darkforest.jpg" height="600px" width="400px">

Kvothe knows neither the names of the stars, or the secrets they hold. He sees
the surface and can't fathom the depths bellow, and so he makes a foolish show:

> Thinking myself clever, I made a sympathetic binding for light and held my hand
> above my head as if it were a torch. I was more than slightly proud of this, as the motion-to-light
> binding is rather difficult without a piece of metal to use as a focus.
> Light swelled and I caught a moment’s glimpse of our surroundings. Dark trunks of trees rose like
> massive pillars as far as the eye could see. There were no low-hanging branches, no undergrowth, no
> grass. Only dark moss underfoot and the arch of dark branches overhead. I was reminded of a vast,
> empty cathedral swathed in sooty velvet.

Felurian heard the deep tremble and so she makes a hasty gamble, two hearts beat as one...

> “ciar nalias!” Felurian snapped.

> An instant later Felurian leapt at me and bore me to the ground, her lithe, naked body pressed against mine.

now something wicked this way comes...

> There was a soft sound of movement above us, as if someone was folding a huge piece of velvet
> around a piece of broken glass. Saying that I realize it makes no sense, but still, that is the best way I
> can describe the sound. It was a soft noise, the half-heard sound of deliberate movement. I cannot tell
> you why it made me think of something terrible and sharp, but it did. My forehead prickled with
> sweat, and I was filled with a sudden pure and breathless terror.

For though the stars seem tiny from afar...

> and when she bent down to run her fingers over the hush of it, she glimpsed a tiny whiteness
> underneath the couch.

they too can scar...

> She was full of broken glass and burrs. She was weary and disappointed with all of everything.

And you would not want to meet them as they truly are...

> She reached deep into the shadows with a small white hand,
> having to stretch a bit before her fingers caught it. 

so stay small as selas, still as stone...

> There was a soft sound of movement above us, as if someone was folding a huge piece of velvet

And pray they leave you alone.

> A languid moment passed, then she laughed, her body shaking with it. It was
> wild and delighted, as if she had just played the most marvelous joke.

## Dreams

Your walking through a forest, the grass is cool under your bare feet. The dark
trunks reach far above, forming a scattered canopy. The moon gives enough light
to see a gentle stream ahead, and across it a stone inn. Wil, just ahead, stops
and finally breaks the silence. He seems sad, Sim is no where to be seen. His
dark eyes find ours and he speaks. You listen with half an ear as a you bend to
inspect three perfect pinecones in a row. You give a slight chuckle. Then your
brows furrow... You take a moment and respond, sure you misheard him.

"When your wives are angry you sleep _in_ the fire?"

You turn to look up at him quizzical.

But he is gone, instead Penthe gives you a pleasant kiss on the cheek. 

"no, no.. " she bats at you playful, then looking at you sudden serious, 

"A man plays no role in it."  her eyes a twilight blue... 

You know she is wrong, you are Kvothe, trained at the medica. She cuts your
thoughts off by clasping your hands inside hers and bringing her head down to
whisper between the secret space the entangled fingers make.

"A man must give a woman fire if he wants to sleep" ... her lids flicker like
butterflies and her eyes are deep pools you could drown in. You feel a pleasant
heat start to rise. To off set it you stare intently at her hands, only to find
your clasping Denna's hands instead. Your back on the greystone with her. The
winter fills your lungs and cuts deep into your blood.

“I stopped breathing for two minutes and died." she doesn't speak the words.
There written on her arms, her chest and across her face in black ink.

You both hang above the Greystone in open air. You firmly
perched on open air, her slipping from your grasp, to fall into its open door. 
Your muscles ache, if only had rope, wine or time to explain.

She looks through your eyes. She knows you will let her go. She doesn't blame
you, there isn't much of her left and he has betrayed you.

You tighten, tense, a finger slips. If only could could make a binding with your
blood, but no, you are bloodless, a hallow bell and when the wind strikes you
there is no sound. 

_You do not let go._

You scream and the mountains tear themselves apart. Your both falling. Your
hands bound as one. Auri holds you tightly in her hand as the darkness reaches to take you.

"It's okay" She says softly. "I'm here. You're safe."

The Draccus roars and its blue flame consumes you both.

Your alone once more, only wood and stream and stone. You see flames lick at
trees off to the south, hear their cries for help and the sound of true copper
as it strides upon the land.

Your knees buckle beneath and you sag to the ground, your tears are hot blood
upon the ground.

## Epilogue

I'll leave you to your own thoughts. Take a moment, go outside, make plans for dinner, maybe white wine, garlic, fresh pasta and a bit of parsley.

Next will sit down and consider the hidden [turnings](/posts-output/2021-1-26-turnings) of the world...
