## Prelude: A hand raised 

In short, this theory will cover Auri's candle making. In long...

The Kingkiller Chronicle's journey is powerful; it moves the heart. It's best if
you experience it yourself, rather than me rob you of the joy. Journey before
destination, and all that.

So I suggest you read around a *lot* before tackling this. That means all the
books, see the last section "Citations" for a complete list. It also means
spending some time on the forums. I'm not suggesting I have the right of things.
Instead, I'm saying it's a lot more fun to arrive at your own conclusions before
hearing others. So capital S Spoilers and possible BS ahead, you decided which.

Enough of warnings, we look forward now, shadows on the horizon, drums in the
deep.


-----------


The main theory is that Auri is Shaping Kvothes life from those of Lanre and Selitos. 

To go further, I must be sure you understand as much about the Fae, their magic,
Waystones and Alchemy as possible. I'll give an overview of the requirements in the next section "A careful
look" then pick up the main theory thread in the section titled "A humerus Chandelier". 

# A careful look

To understand the conclusion, that Auri is Shaping kvothe. You need to
understand the craft she uses to do it. Discussing the means, broadly speaking
_Fae magic_ and Alchemy. Are topics in there own right and so it's better to
break them out.

If your not sure how Fae do what they do, then here is a piece on 
<a href="https://drewverlee.github.io/posts-output/2021-1-22-bitter-brew"> Fae
Magic</a>, where we learn from Bast and observe him working his craft in the
book "The Lighting Tree". Similarly, you will need to have some understanding of [Alchemy](https://drewverlee.github.io/posts-output/2021-1-23-alchemy) in order Auri's candle making.

If you find yourself doubting that Auri is really visiting these locations, then
read <a href="https://drewverlee.github.io/posts-output/2021-1-15-how-to-get-to-newarre">How to get Newarre</a>
where I isolate the topic. If you doubt that Auri could get there quickly, then read
<a href="https://drewverlee.github.io/posts-output/2021-1-23-ways-to-safe-places">Ways to safe places</a>

Each post will try to have summery or conclusion at the top. If you agree with
it, confidently move on.


# A Humerus Chandelier

<img src="/img/auri_honeycomb_c.jpg" height="500px" width="350px" align="right">

Our theory is that Auri is shaping Kvothe From Lanre and Selitos, who are represented  by two items
she finds in the Underthing. To clarify, ill be keeping track of the items (what) and who in a table. The starting point,
which will explain shortly, is here:

 <table style="width:50%">
  <tr>
    <th>Who</th>
    <th>What</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lanre</td>
    <td>Arm Bone</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Selitos</td>
    <td>Crystal</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

...

We first need to establish how these items are like these figures. This is done multiple ways, mostly by association.

E.g If I said, my new boss sure is a bear. And later I said, he is really
grizzly today. We would count this as two connections from my boss to a bear.

The starting point for this theory happens in the repeated use of a single body part where typically it's counter would be
involved forms a pattern. There are two instances of this very close together
in the narrative. The more unusual of the two repeats itself when Lanre is described 
as having "strength of **arm**" rather then "strength of arms" NOWT:26:184:
   
> ..Lanre had the strength of his arm and the command of loyal men...

NOWT:26:187:

> ..his (Lanre) power lay in the strength of his arm. 

The second instance is also unusual, but also directly part of the plotline. And so receives
an understandable amount of attention.

NOWT:26:190:

> Selitos drew a deep breath. “By my eye I was deceived, never again....” He
> raised the stone and drove its needle point into his own eye.

NOTW:28:197:

> Selitos One-Eye stood forward and said, “Lord, if I do thi....

From here we are going to follow these items separately for a bit tell they come back together,
in different forms at the end.

# Breaking Bones

<img src="/img/bone.jpg" height="250px" width="250px" align="center" vspace="20px" hspace="20px">

In Slow Regard of Silent Things (SROST), Auri finds a bone. SROST:1:24:

> she had found: a clean white bone.
> Long, but not a leg. An arm. The prima axial. She ran her fingers down the
> length of it and felt a tiny seam that ran all round it like a ring, showing it
> had broken and long-healed. It was full of pleasant shadows.


Here comes the analogies and metaphors we talked about before, were not going to
discuss why this is important now, rather just note the alike this bone the
"Prima Axial is" to Lanre:

1. The word axial is similar to Alaxel, who the Adem's song tells us is the lord of the Seven. 
2. prima  means "leading man" which Lanre certainly is.
3. "axial" isn't the name for any arm bone, but rather a collection of the middle parts of the body,
as shown [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_skeleton). Auri, who studied
at the university, would know this. 
4. The arm being broken and healed is to the Lanre being killed and raised
5. The arm being full of shadows is like Lanre being surrounded by shadows. 
6. In Vintish culture, a bone ring (see "tiny seam" from quote), indicates a profound and lasting debt, which Lanre has for his life returned.
7. That it's an arm bone, and he was known for his strength of arm.

Fancy that, seven associations.

After retrieving the bone, Auri puts it near some holly, that she has on her.  SROST:1:24:

> The bone nestled almost indecently close to the holly berry. 

Holly is a topic all on it's own that I cover
[here](https://drewverlee.github.io/posts-output/2021-1-24-holly). You might
want to refer back to it later, for now lets move on. What Auri does next is put, I would argue
_trades_, the bone for Laurel Fruit, by placing the Bone inside the Laurel Tree.
SROST:4:70:

<img src="/img/gravetree.jpg" height="300px" width="300px">

> Auri reached into her gathersack and brought out the bone that she
> had found the day before. She bent down and tucked it deep inside the dark and
> hollow space beneath the tree. 

> Then she began to pick the small blue laurel fruit and put them in her gathersack as well.

I dive into if this could be the Latantha or the Cthaeh's tree [here](https://drewverlee.github.io/posts-output/2021-1-14-gravetree). In the 
end I choose the Mauthen Farm. Were going to recap the similarities here, but if you want a more detailed focus look the two locations
read  [here](https://drewverlee.github.io/posts-output/2021-1-15-how-get-get-to-newarre).

### The Mauthen Farm: Hawks and rabbits

<img src="/img/farmer.jpg" height="500px" width="350px">

Here are the ways the graveyard visits are like the Mauthen Farm:

* The Barrows are a grave/bone yard, the pig farmer mentions the Mathen's dug up bones.
* The Oak trees at the farm could be responsible for 
* Auri finds pine cones in the area, The Farm has pine trees which could leave them.
* The Farm is said to have a "stone outcropping", which might be gravestones auri sees.
* They both have mushrooms.
* The leaf Auri breaths on could be the one Kvothe swallows. 
* The graveyard Ivy could be how The Denner Tree's near the farm make addicts teeth white. 
* The Iron fense from the graveyard could be the Iron Wheel in Town near the farm
* Verinan, who kvothe compares to a _Verinan_ red flower, could be the graveyard rose.

So if this is the Mauthen farm whats the lesson? Is the Laurel Tree the barrow
itself, could it stand for Kvothe's mother Laurel? What does it mean for the
story? Will cover this at the end, in the section "The Book of Secrets".

This is the end of the arm bone's story, though it contains through the Laurel
Fruit which will pick up later. Next we will focus on the other item she finds,
a Crystal and the similarities its shares with Selitos.

# Crystal's and Blood

-----------------------------

<img src="/img/crystal.jpg" height="250px" width="250px">

Auri finds a Crystal in the Underthing. SROST:1:27:

> After a dozen steps, a glimmer on the marble floor caught her eye. Skipping
> close, she saw a crystal had fallen from the chandelier to lay unbroken on the
> floor. It was a lucky thing, and brave.

The Crystal is like the mountain glass seltios used to stab his eye. The
connection is thin here, only that Crystal is similar to glass. What do we
know about "mountain glass"? However, the connection is immediately strengthened
as The Crystal is put near an Amyr, given Selitos was their founder.

<img src="/img/Pairs_Commonwealth_Amyr.webp" height="500px" width="350px" align="right">

Here are the relevant parts about the Amyr doll. SROST:1:28

> It was a tiny figurine carved from a piece of pale, retiring stone. A small
> soldier with clever lines to show his hauberk and his shield. But his truest
> treasure was the sweetness of his face, kind enough for kissing. It didn’t
> belong here, but it wasn’t wrong. Or rather, it wasn’t what was wrong with the
> room. The poor thing was simply lost. Auri smiled and put the doll in her
> pocket with the crystal

Later we learn more. SROST:10:146:

> the design upon its shield. It was so faint. But yes. There was the tower
> wrapped up in a tongue of flame. No mere soldier, it was a small stone Amyr.
> Peering closer, Auri spied slight lines upon his arms as well. She did not
> know how she had missed these things before. It was a tiny Ciridae.

Notice, Auri, like kvothe has to look at the amyr twice before seeing it. It
would be odd if seeing had a certain calculus to it. Given Puppet suggests you can look too much.
Which given the strong, likelihood he is connected/is Selito's complicates matters even further. 
I had long wondered if Kvothe's first viewing hadn't been more true, but I doubtful Auri could
be deceived by anyone but herself.

Later Auri adds white tatted lace to the same pocket as the Amyr and Crystal. SROST:1:32

> she found a length of fine white tatted lace. She folded this up carefully and
> put it in her pocket with the crystal and the small stone soldier

The white tatted lace is likely related to Nettie William, Rike's mom. A
connection which, will I'll explain shortly. 

<img src="/img/bastandgirl.jpg" height="350px" width="210px" align="right">

Finally, Auri trades the Crystal for butter & honeycomb, when she leaves the
Crystal under the Lighting Tree near Rike's house. 

Relationships between the Farm Auri's visits (SROST) and the Williams Farm (TLT):

* The girl that see's Auri with her serious eye's is Nettie's daughter Tess.
* The same dog bay's at Auri and Bast
* Nettie has a trio of Goat's, Auri meets one or a relative.
* The honey that Auri takes is from Nettie, who has bee hives and also used it
  for candles.
* The farmhouse auri visits has a bearskin upon a rack to cure and Rikes father
  Jessom hunts and traps.
* Both Auri's farmhouse and the Williams have a garden
* Both locations have a barn
* The etymology of [Nettie](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nettie) is Net - tie, where net's are like tatted lace. 
  
This isn't the Cthaeh, so near a farm with milk, honey and curious eyes. This could possible
be the Sword Tree, but while the butter has knifes. Their are no mountains to
see, or swords. 

So then, The Lighting Tree. 

<img src="/img/lightingtree.jpeg" height="500px" width="300px">

---------------------------

<img src="/img/honeytree.jpg" height="500px" width="300px">

That being established, we must review the trade Auri makes for the honey. This happens in three parts:

1. Auri trades for the Nettie's butter & honeycomb for her White Tatted Lace. 
2. She is spotted by Tess, this increases the cost of the trade.
3. She leaves the cyrstal in the tree to pay the extra debt

---------

SROST:4:

1. trade. 

> Carefully she brought out the length of fine white tatted lace. She folded it
> and left it near the churn. It was the careful work of many long and drowsy
> autumn days. It would find purpose in a place like this. Then Auri took the
> clean white cloth that had held the hollyberry earlier and rubbed it with some
> butter.

Sense she only takes a bit of butter, lets just round this down to honeycomb.

<img src="/img/honey.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">

2. spotted. 

> a prickle on her neck told her that she was being watched... A little girl was watching her

3. debt paid 

> She cast her eyes around and saw a tree, a dark hole in its trunk ...

> The hole was perfect, just deep enough so that a little girl
> could reach inside and feel around. If she were curious, that is. If she were
> brave enough to stick her arm in nearly to her shoulder.

> Auri pulled the crystal from her pocket. She kissed it, brave explorer that it
> was, and lucky too. It was the perfect thing. This was the perfect place. True,
> she was no longer in the Underthing. But even so, this was so true it could not
> be denied. She wrapped the crystal in a leaf and lay it in the bottom of the
> hole. 

Does she mean for the girl to fall down the rabbit hole and go on mad fun
adventures? Or is this a bobble, a bait, a way to float her down into the
darkness.

<img src="/img/alice.jpeg" height="500px" width="300px">
<img src="/img/float.jpeg" height="500px" width="300px">

Finally, What use does our white tatted lace find? TLT:

> “I learned loads of things today, Reshi,” Bast protested. The
> innkeeper sat up, looking more attentive. “Really?” he said. “Impress me then.”
> Bast thought for a moment. “Nettie Williams found a wild hive of bees today,” he
> said. “And she managed to catch the queen …”

This is the end of the journey for the cyrstal, the begging of the honeycombs.

# The Light's Boundary

Auri use's the honeycomb and laurel fruit to make a candle for kvothe. Much could be said, here. 
Without elaborating, the ingredients are:

* laurel fruit 
* honey 
* perfect lavender 
* melting wax 
* daub of perfect pitch 
* auri breath in whistle 

Note, If the leaf kvothe swallowed on the Mauthen farm was the one Auri breathed on,
then her whistle is the second reference to her breath going in him. 

Auri find's that in the end she doesn't have time for the proper making of the candle, as too often is
the case, when she is pressed upon time, she turns to Boundry, she goes
beyond...

# Book of secrets

<img src="/img/book-of-secrets.webp" height="250px" width="250px">

So Auri took some items that I claim are like Selitos and Lanre and traded them
for some other items and then turned those into a candle. What of it? _what does it all mean!_ 

Recall what you now know of the Fae craft and Alchemy. Now let your imagination run wild. 

But if your tired of secrets, or if you feel you know all the stars and their
names, then follow me deeper down the rabbit hole and see the [Shadows on the wal](/posts-output/2021-1-25-findings).

# Epilogue

## In a box

I see no mention of the candle after he receives it from auri. As far as I can
tell kvothe puts the candle in his box in Ankers. TWMF:50:358

> I finished loading my travelsack, then packed everything else into the trunk that sat at the foot of my bed. A few worn tools, a broken piece of slate I used for ciphering, a small wooden box with the handful of small treasures Auri had given me....

## Giving back

If you enjoyed this consider supporting Heifer International, either [directly](https://www.heifer.org/) through [worldbuilers](https://worldbuilders.org/).

A cause which Rothfuss, the orchestrator of all good and bad times had on Temerant, believes in.
And you should also buy all the Cool Worldbuilders KingKiller stuff, which really helps, um, build the world?

## Credits

Though the idea is mine and i take full responsible for any undo confusion, I
had help in piecing together bits here and there about the story from

* u/mattytangle, for deep knowing
* u/rhinatamorie, for kind words
* u/throwawaybreaks, for listening
* Yamus (on KKC discord), for careful criticism
* u/quoo, for Auri's soap
* u/aowshadow for a detailed review of this post
* u/biologin for the Rothuss alchemy quotes, and likely other bits i picked up
* u/mastersam for insights

They have some great KKC theories out there you should check out.

Thanks to the r/KingkillerChronicle and r/kkcwhiteboard. I'll be cutting back a lot on the time
I spend theory crafting, after i finish this, as i need to put my attention back on other matters.
But discovering the book anew and community was a much needed adventure in a dark time.

## Left over Questions

Here are some questions I jotted down but didn't try to answer which putting this together:

* Is bast somehow the suet?
* What are the White lace origins?
* Is Aunt Sellie "ellie"? Elle on gravestone (see card)? A place where no men live?
* If the laurel tree isn't the borrow, what was the fruit? What does it imply? Is it kvothe's mother?
* why did auri leave out the camphor, I touch on it  <a href="https://drewverlee.github.io/posts-output/2021-1-24-camphor"> Here</a>, but its thin.
* Why would crystal and key fuss? What is the key?
* look into origins of arm bone.

## Rights & Art

* All (most) of the pictures are likely property of Worldbuilders ,I have enjoyed my
purchases from them greatly and hope using them this isn't stepping on any toes.
* Celtic Holly picture from Anne Stokes
