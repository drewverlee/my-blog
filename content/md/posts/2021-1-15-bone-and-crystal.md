### Prelude: A hand raised 

The Kingkiller Chronicle's journey is powerful, it moves the heart. Its best if
you experience it yourself, rather then me rob you of the joy. Journey before
destination, and all that.

So I suggest you read around a lot before tackling this. That means all the books: SROST, TLT, NOTW, TWMF, OH
I'm not suggesting i have the right of things. Rather i'm saying it's a lot more fun to arrive at
your own conclusions before hearing others. So capital S Spoilers and possible BS ahead, you decided which.

In short, this theory will cover Auri's candle making. In long....

# A Humerus Chandelier

<img src="/img/auri_honeycomb_c.jpg" height="500px" width="350px" align="right">

The main theory is that the Arm bone and Cyrstal that Auri finds in the underthing are related 
to Lanre and Selitos respectively.

Four points of clarification:

1. I say simply _related_ because it's unclear how, and for the purposes of the bulk of
this theory, the concern is to prove how alike they are through story and metaphor. Will
leave it to the very ending to speculate on what it means.

2. This theory's strength comes not from one strong connection. But from
several weak ones. Like a spiders web, the trap isn't ready tell it's fully woven. 

3. I'll be carving out non essential details in order to make this concise. I expect readers
to have combed the books many times and hopefully will do so here to help support or refute these claims. You should defiantly read around the quotes i pull. 

4. the relationships starting point is this:


---------------

 <table style="width:50%">
  <tr>
    <th>Who</th>
    <th>What</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lanre</td>
    <td>Arm Bone</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Selitos</td>
    <td>Crystal</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

---------------

As a starting point, the repeated use of a single body part where typically it's counter would be
involved forms a pattern. There are two instances of this very close together
in the narrative. The more unusual of the two repeats itself when Lanre is described 
as having "strength of **arm**" rather then "strength of arms":
   
> ... Lanre had the strength of his arm and the command of loyal men...

> ... his (Lanre) power lay in the strength of his arm. 

The second instance is also unusual, but also directly part of the plotline. And so receives
an understandable amount of attention.

> Selitos One-Eye stood forward and said, “Lord, if I do thi....

> Selitos drew a deep breath. “By my eye I was deceived, never again....” He
> raised the stone and drove its needle point into his own eye.

From here we are going to follow these items separately for a bit tell they come back together,
in different forms at the end.

# Breaking Bones
<img src="/img/bone.jpg" height="250px" width="250px" align="center" vspace="20px" hspace="20px">

In Slow regard of silent things (SROST), Auri finds a bone:

> she had found: a clean white bone.
> Long, but not a leg. An arm. The prima axial. She ran her fingers down the
> length of it and felt a tiny seam that ran all round it like a ring, showing it
> had broken and long-healed. It was full of pleasant shadows.

Let us say how this "Prima Axial" is like Lanre:

1. The word axial is similar to Alaxel, who the Adem's song tells us is the lord of the Seven. 
2. prima  means "leading man" which Lanre certainly is.
3. "axial" isn't the name for any arm bone, but rather a collection of the middle parts of the body,
as shown [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_skeleton). Auri, who studied
at the university, would know this. Her naming is deliberate. She says _arm_ because he was known 
for his strength of _arm_. 
4. The arm being broken and healed is to the Lanre being killed and raised
5. The arm being full of shadows is like Lanre being surrounded by shadows. 
6. In Vinta's culture, a bone ring (see "tiny seam" from quote), indicates a profound and lasting debt, which Lanre has for his life returned.

After retrieving the bone, Auri put's it near holly at some point:

> The bone nestled almost indecently close to the holly berry. 

Holly is a topic all on it's own and so deserves some consideration.

## Holly 

I believe holly berry is a metaphor for creation. The Lady/Lyra uses it to bring
back Lanre in the form of Old Holly the warrior. For further exploration,
consult this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/krxwj0/lets_discuss_old_holly_berries_and_birth/), though it wasn't written with this in mind.

Holly is what the Sithe wear when they ride out hunting skin dancers, so we presume it has some protective powers

<img src="/img/sithe.webp" height="400px" width="250px" align="right">

Bast tell's us the Sithe guard the Cthaeh, and treat anyone who comes in contact
with it like a disease they need to burn out of this world. Kvothe casual walked
up to it however, so something is amiss.I like to think they allowed it.
Furthermore and that they are shooting down the butterfly's. Butterfly's
pollinate, which help plants reproduce, by moving the male bits to the female bits on
another plant. So is kvothe a pollinature of another sort? Felurian doesn't
think he is bitten, but she doesn't look to hard. And she is a bit of a twilight
flower, if you will excuse the expression, herself.

Holly is also features predominantly in How Old Holly came to be (shocker):

> Old Holly bent his boughs again, and brought a spear, its wood of living green. Its blade as bright as berry blood. This he drove into...

And has implications for our tired Inn Keeper:

> The innkeeper ’s fingers fumbled clumsily, snapping the holly branch and jabbing a thorn deep into the fleshy part of his thumb. The red-haired man didn’t flinch or curse, just scowled angrily down at his hand as a bead of blood welled up, bright as a berry.

Will say more about holly later, but for now lets move Auri's journey forward as she visits a graveyard.

##  Bones and Berries

<img src="/img/gravetree.jpg" height="300px" width="300px">


There she puts, I would argue _trades_, the bone for Laurel Fruit, by placing the Bone 
inside the Laurel Tree:

> Auri reached into her gathersack and brought out the bone that she
> had found the day before. She bent down and tucked it deep inside the dark and
> hollow space beneath the tree. 

> Then she began to pick the small blue laurel fruit and put them in her gathersack as well.

I dive into if this could be the sword tree or the Cthaeh's tree [here](https://drewverlee.github.io/posts-output/2021-1-14-gravetree). But ill summarize:

1. Auri described the Tree as lonely, which suits the Cthaeh very well.

> And as I ran I could hear Cthaeh speaking behind me. Its dry, quiet voice
> followed me longer than I would have thought possible. “Come back. Come back.
> I’ve more to say. I’ve so much more to tell you, won’t you stay?”

2. The Cthaeh's dead butterfly's are like a graveyard.
3. At a long stretch, I think Kvothe will lay waste to Hearth trying to get to
   Cinder who I believe he will find there, thus making it a graveyard.
   So then the Adems stone houses as analogous to gravestones in two ways, which 
   only work based on a theory I haven't substantiated.
4. Only English/Cherry Laurel's have dark blue fruit in reality. That isn't the
   tree featured in the book. It's possible someone: Pat or Auri is confused. It's
   possible Auri was picking up the berries from the Ivy, which might make it
   a Hedra _Helix_, which is a type of Ivy. The name of which is lose to Haliax. But word similarity is a
   too thin to base an idea on alone
5. The Sword Tree fits Lanre better, who was known for his sword prowess.
6. Both Felurian and the Adem have _Ivy and Oak_ in their _art_, The Laurel tree
   with blue fruit isn't an oak, But there is a tree known as Laurel Oak that is
   hard to tell apart from an oak.
7. Kovthe, mentions in song that he thinks Savien is like an "rock-old oak". Or
   that he is, sense he is sing Savien's part.
8. Auri has ivory skin and Cinder has Ivory teeth, which might indicate an
addition of some sort. The obvious guess is Denner Resin, But i wonder if it isn't 
Trillium, which kvothe calls Denna, which Felurian eats. aka _birthroot_:

<img src="/img/trill.jpeg" height="300px" width="300px">

For me, If it has to be one of the two prime tree's, the Latantha is closer.
However, graveyard and lonely make it nearly a tie. In the end, i suspect *waves
hands* the tree's roots are linked. A theory I hope to cover _any day now_. 

<img src="/img/anydaynow.jpg" height="400px" width="250px">

But let's have a taste shall we?

Celtic Mythology paints a picture of two who are one, but at war, warring with
against each other, warring with themselves. The Oak and Holly. During Midsummer
the Oak King is at the height of strength, the Holly king regains power at the
Autumn equinox, his power peaking at midwinter, at which point the oak king is
reborn.

<img src="/img/hollyoak.jpeg" height="300px" width="400px">

Guess who else dabbles in duality's?

<img src="/img/summersoap.webp" height="225px" width="300px">
<img src="/img/perfectsoap.jpeg" height="225px" width="300px">

Later, you might want to read  u/quoo's master piece theory on
Auri's [soap](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/48jv6c/kkc_spoilers_all_the_allegory_of_auris_magnum/),

I'm not suggesting that Celtic Mythology plays a role here, The Four
Corners has it's own lore. For one It's Ivy climbing Oak, Holly isn't an Ivy.

I'm just i'm highlighting that such devices are part of our blood, our very
creation, a topic I tried to capture in
[*story and art*](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wkduktjjd5rc1gq/Story.pdf?dl=0). Here is a
sample of some of roaring heart wilting poetry i spin into being:

<img src="/img/blackwhite.png" height="200px" width="400px" style="border: 5px solid #8B0000;">

### Farms, Hawks and rabbits

<img src="/img/farmer.jpg" height="500px" width="350px">

Coming back to the main theory, The Mauthen farm has some strong similarities as well:

* The Barrows are a grave/bone yard, the pig farmer mentions the Mathen's dug up bones.
* The Oak trees at the farm could be responsible for 
* Auri finds pine cones in the area, The Farm has pine trees which could leave them.
* The Farm is said to have a "stone outcropping", which might be gravestones auri sees.
* They both have mushrooms.
* The leaf Auri breaths on could be the one Kvothe swallows. 
* The graveyard Ivy could be how The Denner Tree's near the farm make addicts teeth white. 
* The Iron fense from the graveyard could be the Iron Wheel in Town near the farm
* Verinan, who kvothe compares to a _Verinan_ red flower, could be the graveyard rose.


So if this is the Mauthen farm whats the lesson? Is the Laurel Tree the barrow itself?
What does it mean for the story? 

This is the end of the arm bone's story, though it contains through the Laurel Fruit which will pick up later.

# Crystal's and Blood

-----------------------------

<img src="/img/crystal.jpg" height="250px" width="250px">

Auri finds a Crystal in the Underthing:

> After a dozen steps, a glimmer on the marble floor caught her eye. Skipping
> close, she saw a crystal had fallen from the chandelier to lay unbroken on the
> floor. It was a lucky thing, and brave.

The Crystal is like the mountain glass seltios used to stab his eye. The
connection is thin here, only that Crystal is similar to glass. What do we
know about "mountain glass"? However, the connection is immediately strengthened
as The Crystal is put near an Amyr, given Selitos was their founder.

<img src="/img/Pairs_Commonwealth_Amyr.webp" height="500px" width="350px" align="right">

Here are the relevant parts about the Amyr doll:

> It was a tiny figurine carved from a piece of pale, retiring stone. A small
> soldier with clever lines to show his hauberk and his shield. But his truest
> treasure was the sweetness of his face, kind enough for kissing. It didn’t
> belong here, but it wasn’t wrong. Or rather, it wasn’t what was wrong with the
> room. The poor thing was simply lost. Auri smiled and put the doll in her
> pocket with the crystal

Later we learn more:

> the design upon its shield. It was so faint. But yes. There was the tower
> wrapped up in a tongue of flame. No mere soldier, it was a small stone Amyr.
> Peering closer, Auri spied slight lines upon his arms as well. She did not
> know how she had missed these things before. It was a tiny Ciridae.

Notice, Auri, like kvothe has to look at the amyr twice before seeing it. It
would be odd if seeing had a certain calculus to it. Given Puppet suggests you can look too much.
Which given the strong, likelihood he is connected/is Selito's complicates matters even further. 
I had long wondered if Kvothe's first viewing hadn't been more true, but I doubtful Auri could
be deceived by anyone but herself.

Later Auri adds white tatted lace to the same pocket as the Amyr and Crystal:

> she found a length of fine white tatted lace. She folded this up carefully and
> put it in her pocket with the crystal and the small stone soldier

The white tatted lace is likely related to Nettie William, Rike's mom. A
connection which, will I'll explain shortly. 

<img src="/img/bastandgirl.jpg" height="300px" width="200px" align="right">

Finally, Auri trades the Crystal for butter & honeycomb, when she leaves the
Crystal under the Lighting Tree near Rike's house.

Relationships between Auri's Farm and the Williams:

* The girl that see's Auri  with her serious eye's is Nettie's daughter Tess.
* The same dog bay's at Auri and Bast
* Nettie has a trio of Goat's, Auri meets one.
* The honey that Auri takes is from Nettie, who has bee hives and also used it for candles.
* The etymology of [Nettie](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nettie) is Net - tie, where net's are like tatted lace. 
* I'll mention that the lace the Sithe's tated lace also looks like the armor
  the Sithe wear. Though that mixes more then clarifies the relationships.

This isn't the Cthaeh, so near a farm with milk and honey. This could possible
be the Sword Tree, but while the butter has knifes. Their are no mountains to
see. 

So then, The Lighting Tree. 

<img src="/img/lightingtree.jpeg" height="500px" width="300px">

---------------------------

<img src="/img/honeytree.jpg" height="500px" width="300px">

That being established, we must review the trade Auri makes for the honey. This happens in three parts:

1. Auri trades for the Nettie's butter & honeycomb for her White Tatted Lace. 
2. She is spotted by Tess, this increases the cost of the trade.
3. She leaves the cyrstal in the tree to pay the extra debt

---------

1. trade

> Carefully she brought out the length of fine white tatted lace. She folded it
> and left it near the churn. It was the careful work of many long and drowsy
> autumn days. It would find purpose in a place like this. Then Auri took the
> clean white cloth that had held the hollyberry earlier and rubbed it with some
> butter.

Sense she only takes a bit of butter, lets just round this down to honeycomb.

<img src="/img/honey.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">

2. spotted

> a prickle on her neck told her that she was being watched... A little girl was watching her

3. debt paid 

> She cast her eyes around and saw a tree, a dark hole in its trunk ...

> The hole was perfect, just deep enough so that a little girl
> could reach inside and feel around. If she were curious, that is. If she were
> brave enough to stick her arm in nearly to her shoulder.

> Auri pulled the crystal from her pocket. She kissed it, brave explorer that it
> was, and lucky too. It was the perfect thing. This was the perfect place. True,
> she was no longer in the Underthing. But even so, this was so true it could not
> be denied. She wrapped the crystal in a leaf and lay it in the bottom of the
> hole. 

Does she mean for the girl to fall down the rabbit hole and go on mad fun
adventures? Or is this a bobble, a bait, a way to float her down into the
darkness.

<img src="/img/alice.jpeg" height="500px" width="300px">
<img src="/img/float.jpeg" height="500px" width="300px">

Finally, What use does our white tatted lace find? 

> “I learned loads of things today, Reshi,” Bast protested. The
> innkeeper sat up, looking more attentive. “Really?” he said. “Impress me then.”
> Bast thought for a moment. “Nettie Williams found a wild hive of bees today,” he
> said. “And she managed to catch the queen …”

This is the end of the journey for the cyrstal, the begging of the honeycombs.

# The Light's Boundary

Auri use's the honeycomb and laurel fruit to make a candle for kvothe. Much could be said, here. 
Without elaborating, the ingredients are:

* laurel fruit 
* honey 
* perfect lavender 
* melting wax 
* daub of perfect pitch 
* auri breath in whistle 

Note, If the leaf kvothe swallowed on the Mauthen farm was the one Auri breathed on,
then her whistle is the second reference to her breath going in him. 

Auri find's that in the end she doesn't have time for the proper making of the candle, as too often is
the case, when she is pressed upon time, she turns to Boundry, she goes
beyond...

## All Flames are one Flame

Candles feature predominantly in the narrative. 
Sometimes, they are obvious, though the tale is hard to [read](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/k7gnl1/inspecting_the_playing_cards/)

# Epilogue

## In a box


I see no mention of the candle after he receives it from auri.As far as i can
tell kvothe puts the candle in his box in Ankers:

> I finished loading my travelsack, then packed everything else into the trunk that sat at the foot of my bed. A few worn tools, a broken piece of slate I used for ciphering, a small wooden box with the handful of small treasures Auri had given me....

## deceived

_In the end, they were all of them deceived_

_For though they knew the safe and prideful path._

_Their hearts new true._ 

_And so as they turned their heads once in wrong,_ 

_they turned again to renew:_

In the interest of fairness I'll explain my idea here, rather then leave it to
poetry. Which implies i have some deep understanding here, which i don't. I
think both meanings to volatile are relevant here. The first being an
inclination to change rabidly, unpredictable, for the worse. Kvothe is certainly
that to some degree already. I suspect Auri is _deeply_ conflicted on shaping
him more so. The second meaning, that a substance is volatile if changes from
liquid to gas at low (say normal) temperature might be an explanation of how the
Seven are
[gas](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/evvie5/the_chandrian_signs_are_full_of_gas/),
and how move from place to place:

> Haliax spread his arms and the shadow surrounding him bloomed like a flower

> toward Haliax, into the shadow surrounding him. But as their feet came down

Auri was supposed to shape Kvothe to volatile, she _declined_. A small thing,
and yet it might make all the difference.

## Giving back

If you enjoyed this consider supporting Heifer International, either [directly](https://www.heifer.org/) through [worldbuilers](https://worldbuilders.org/).

A cause which Rothfuss, the orchestrate of all good and bad times had on Temerant, believes in.
And you should also buy all the Cool Worldbuilders KingKiller stuff, which really helps, um, build the world?

## Credits

Though the idea is mine and i take full responsible for any undo confusion, I
had help in piecing together bits here and there about the story from
u/mattytangle and Yamus (on KKC discord). They have some great KKC theories out
there you should check out.

Thanks to the r/KingkillerChronicle and r/kkcwhiteboard. I'll be cutting back a lot on the time
I spend theory crafting as i need to put my attention back on other matters.
But I discovering the book anew and community was a needed adventure. 

## Left over Questions

Here are some questions I jotted down but didn't try to answer which putting this together:

* Is bast somehow the suet that Auri takes with here?
* What are the White lace origins?
* What/where is Trumble? Is Newaree there?
* Is Aunt Sellie "ellie"? Elle on gravestone? A place where no men live?
* If the laurel tree is the borrow, what was the fruit? What does it imply?
* Is that a hawk in that farmer picture? We should back that claim with part of the story.

## Rights

All (most) of the pictures are likely property of Worldbuilders ,I have enjoyed my
purchases from them greatly and hope using them this isn't stepping on any toes.
