## Prelude: A hand raised 

In short, this theory will cover Auri's candle making. In long...

The Kingkiller Chronicle's journey is powerful; it moves the heart. It's best if
you experience it yourself, rather than me rob you of the joy. Journey before
destination, and all that.

So I suggest you read around a *lot* before tackling this. That means all the
books, see the last section "Citations" for a complete list. It also means
spending some time on the forums. I'm not suggesting I have the right of things.
Instead, I'm saying it's a lot more fun to arrive at your own conclusions before
hearing others. So capital S Spoilers and possible BS ahead, you decided which.
Enough of warnings, we look forward now, shadows on the horizon, drums in the
deep.


-----------


The main theory is that Auri is Shaping Kvothes life from those of Lanre and Selitos. 

To go further, I must be sure you understand as much about the Fae, their magic,
way stones and Alchemy as possible. I'll give an overview of this in the next section "A careful
look" then pick up the main theory thread in "A humerus Chandelier". 

# A careful look

To understand the conclusion, that Auri is Shaping kvothe. You need to
understand the craft she uses to do it. Discussing the means, broadly speaking
"fae magic" and Alchemy. Are topics in there own right and so it's better to
break them out.

If your not sure how Fae do what they do, then here is a piece on 

<a href="https://drewverlee.github.io/posts-output/2021-1-22-bitter-brew"> Fae
Magic</a>, where we learn from Bast and observe him working his craft in the
book "The Lighting Tree". Similarly, you will need to have some understanding of [Alchemy](https://drewverlee.github.io/posts-output/2021-1-23-alchemy) in order Auri's candle making.

If you find yourself doubting that Auri is really visiting these locations, then
read <a href="https://drewverlee.github.io/posts-output/2021-1-15-how-to-get-to-newarre">How to get Newarre</a>
where I isolate the topic. If you doubt that Auri could get there quickly, then read
<a href="https://drewverlee.github.io/posts-output/2021-1-23-ways-to-safe-places">Ways to safe places</a>

Each post will try to have summery or conclusion at the top. If you agree with
it, confidently move on.


# A Humerus Chandelier

<img src="/img/auri_honeycomb_c.jpg" height="500px" width="350px" align="right">

Our theory is that Auri is shaping Kvothe From Lanre and Selitos, who are represented  by two items
she finds in the Underthing. To clarify, ill be keeping track for us:

 <table style="width:50%">
  <tr>
    <th>Who</th>
    <th>What</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lanre</td>
    <td>Arm Bone</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Selitos</td>
    <td>Crystal</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

...

We first need to establish how these items are like these figures. This is done multiple ways, mostly by association.

E.g If I said, my new boss sure is a bear. And later I said, he is really
grizzly today. We would count this as two connections from my boss to a bear.

The starting point for this theory happens in the repeated use of a single body part where typically it's counter would be
involved forms a pattern. There are two instances of this very close together
in the narrative. The more unusual of the two repeats itself when Lanre is described 
as having "strength of **arm**" rather then "strength of arms" NOWT:26:184:
   
> ..Lanre had the strength of his arm and the command of loyal men...

NOWT:26:187:

> ..his (Lanre) power lay in the strength of his arm. 

The second instance is also unusual, but also directly part of the plotline. And so receives
an understandable amount of attention.

NOWT:26:190:

> Selitos drew a deep breath. “By my eye I was deceived, never again....” He
> raised the stone and drove its needle point into his own eye.

NOTW:28:197:

> Selitos One-Eye stood forward and said, “Lord, if I do thi....

From here we are going to follow these items separately for a bit tell they come back together,
in different forms at the end.

# Breaking Bones
<img src="/img/bone.jpg" height="250px" width="250px" align="center" vspace="20px" hspace="20px">

In Slow Regard of Silent Things (SROST), Auri finds a bone. SROST:1:24:

> she had found: a clean white bone.
> Long, but not a leg. An arm. The prima axial. She ran her fingers down the
> length of it and felt a tiny seam that ran all round it like a ring, showing it
> had broken and long-healed. It was full of pleasant shadows.

Let us say how this "Prima Axial" is like Lanre:

1. The word axial is similar to Alaxel, who the Adem's song tells us is the lord of the Seven. 
2. prima  means "leading man" which Lanre certainly is.
3. "axial" isn't the name for any arm bone, but rather a collection of the middle parts of the body,
as shown [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_skeleton). Auri, who studied
at the university, would know this. 
4. The arm being broken and healed is to the Lanre being killed and raised
5. The arm being full of shadows is like Lanre being surrounded by shadows. 
6. In Vintish culture, a bone ring (see "tiny seam" from quote), indicates a profound and lasting debt, which Lanre has for his life returned.
7. That it's an arm bone, and he was known for his strength of arm.

Fancy that, seven associations.

After retrieving the bone, Auri puts it near holly at some point. SROST:1:24:

> The bone nestled almost indecently close to the holly berry. 

Holly is a topic all on it's own and so deserves some consideration.

## Holly 

I believe holly berry is a metaphor for creation. The Lady/Lyra uses it to bring
back Lanre in the form of Old Holly the warrior. For further exploration,
consult this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/krxwj0/lets_discuss_old_holly_berries_and_birth/), though it wasn't written with this in mind.

Holly is what the Sithe wear when they ride out hunting skin dancers, so we presume it has some protective powers

<img src="/img/sithe.webp" height="400px" width="250px" align="right">

Bast tells us the Sithe guard the Cthaeh, and treat anyone who comes in contact
with it like a disease they need to burn out of this world. Kvothe casual walked
up to it however, so something is amiss.I like to think they allowed it.
Furthermore and that they are shooting down the butterflies. Butterflies
pollinate, which help plants reproduce, by moving the male bits to the female bits on
another plant. So is kvothe a pollinature of another sort? Felurian doesn't
think he is bitten, but she doesn't look to hard. And she is a bit of a twilight
flower, if you will excuse the expression, herself.

Holly is also features predominantly in How Old Holly came to be OH:

> Old Holly bent his boughs again, and brought a spear, its wood of living green. Its blade as bright as berry blood. This he drove into...

And has implications for our tired Inn Keeper. WMF:2:423

> The innkeeper ’s fingers fumbled clumsily, snapping the holly branch and jabbing a thorn deep into the fleshy part of his thumb. The red-haired man didn’t flinch or curse, just scowled angrily down at his hand as a bead of blood welled up, bright as a berry.

Will say more about holly later, but for now lets move Auri's journey forward as she visits a graveyard.

##  Bones and Berries

<img src="/img/gravetree.jpg" height="300px" width="300px">


There she puts, I would argue _trades_, the bone for Laurel Fruit, by placing the Bone 
inside the Laurel Tree. SROST:4:70:

> Auri reached into her gathersack and brought out the bone that she
> had found the day before. She bent down and tucked it deep inside the dark and
> hollow space beneath the tree. 

> Then she began to pick the small blue laurel fruit and put them in her gathersack as well.

I dive into if this could be the sword tree or the Cthaeh's tree [here](https://drewverlee.github.io/posts-output/2021-1-14-gravetree). But ill summarize:

1. Auri described the Tree as lonely, which suits the Cthaeh very well. WMF:104:685:

> And as I ran I could hear Cthaeh speaking behind me. Its dry, quiet voice
> followed me longer than I would have thought possible. “Come back. Come back.
> I’ve more to say. I’ve so much more to tell you, won’t you stay?”

2. The Cthaeh's dead butterfly's are like a graveyard.
3. At a long stretch, I think Kvothe will lay waste to Hearth trying to get to
   Cinder who I believe he will find there, thus making it a graveyard.
   So then the Adems stone houses as analogous to gravestones in two ways, which 
   only work based on a theory I haven't substantiated.
4. Only English/Cherry Laurel's have dark blue fruit in reality. That isn't the
   tree featured in the book. It's possible someone: Pat or Auri is confused. It's
   possible Auri was picking up the berries from the Ivy, which might make it
   a Hedra _Helix_, which is a type of Ivy. The name of which is lose to Haliax. But word similarity is a
   too thin to base an idea on alone
5. The Sword Tree fits Lanre better, who was known for his sword prowess.
6. Both Felurian and the Adem have _Ivy and Oak_ in their _art_, The Laurel tree
   with blue fruit isn't an oak, But there is a tree known as Laurel Oak that is
   hard to tell apart from an oak.
7. Kovthe, when he won his talent pipes singing "The Lay of Sir Savien Traliard" compares Saviens voice to a "rock-old oak". 

NOTW:44:

> And we sang! Her voice like burning silver, my voice an echoing answer. Savien sang solid, powerful lines, like branches of a rock-old oak, all the while Aloine was like a nightingale, moving in darting circles around the proud limbs of it.


Except, it's him singing. So we might say kvothe considers himself an Oak.

8. Auri has ivory skin and Cinder has Ivory teeth, which might indicate an
addition of some sort. The obvious guess is Denner Resin, But i wonder if it isn't 
Trillium, which kvothe calls Denna, which Felurian eats. aka _birthroot_:

<img src="/img/trill.jpeg" height="300px" width="300px">

For me, If it has to be one of the two prime tree's, the Latantha is closer.
However, graveyard and lonely make it nearly a tie. In the end, i suspect *waves
hands* the tree's roots are linked. A theory I hope to cover _any day now_. 

<img src="/img/anydaynow.jpg" height="400px" width="250px">

But let's have a taste shall we?

Celtic Mythology paints a picture of two who are one, but at war, warring with
against each other, warring with themselves. The Oak and Holly. During Midsummer
the Oak King is at the height of strength, the Holly king regains power at the
Autumn equinox, his power peaking at midwinter, at which point the oak king is
reborn.

<img src="/img/hollyoak.jpeg" height="300px" width="400px">

Guess who else dabbles in duality's?

<img src="/img/summersoap.webp" height="225px" width="300px">
<img src="/img/perfectsoap.jpeg" height="225px" width="300px">

Later, you might want to read  u/quoo's master piece theory on
Auri's [soap](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/48jv6c/kkc_spoilers_all_the_allegory_of_auris_magnum/),

I'm not suggesting that Celtic Mythology plays a role here, The Four
Corners has it's own lore. For one It's Ivy climbing Oak, Holly isn't an Ivy.

I'm just i'm highlighting that such devices are part of our blood, our very
creation, a topic I tried to capture in
[*story and art*](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wkduktjjd5rc1gq/Story.pdf?dl=0). Here is a
sample of some of roaring heart wilting poetry i spin into being:

<img src="/img/blackwhite.png" height="200px" width="400px" style="border: 5px solid #8B0000;">

### Farms, Hawks and rabbits

<img src="/img/farmer.jpg" height="500px" width="350px">

Coming back to the main theory, The Mauthen farm has some strong similarities as well:

TODO update with info

* The Barrows are a grave/bone yard, the pig farmer mentions the Mathen's dug up bones.
* The Oak trees at the farm could be responsible for 
* Auri finds pine cones in the area, The Farm has pine trees which could leave them.
* The Farm is said to have a "stone outcropping", which might be gravestones auri sees.
* They both have mushrooms.
* The leaf Auri breaths on could be the one Kvothe swallows. 
* The graveyard Ivy could be how The Denner Tree's near the farm make addicts teeth white. 
* The Iron fense from the graveyard could be the Iron Wheel in Town near the farm
* Verinan, who kvothe compares to a _Verinan_ red flower, could be the graveyard rose.


So if this is the Mauthen farm whats the lesson? Is the Laurel Tree the barrow itself?
What does it mean for the story? 

This is the end of the arm bone's story, though it contains through the Laurel Fruit which will pick up later.

# Crystal's and Blood

-----------------------------

<img src="/img/crystal.jpg" height="250px" width="250px">

Auri finds a Crystal in the Underthing. SROST:1:27:

> After a dozen steps, a glimmer on the marble floor caught her eye. Skipping
> close, she saw a crystal had fallen from the chandelier to lay unbroken on the
> floor. It was a lucky thing, and brave.

The Crystal is like the mountain glass seltios used to stab his eye. The
connection is thin here, only that Crystal is similar to glass. What do we
know about "mountain glass"? However, the connection is immediately strengthened
as The Crystal is put near an Amyr, given Selitos was their founder.

<img src="/img/Pairs_Commonwealth_Amyr.webp" height="500px" width="350px" align="right">

Here are the relevant parts about the Amyr doll. SROST:1:28

> It was a tiny figurine carved from a piece of pale, retiring stone. A small
> soldier with clever lines to show his hauberk and his shield. But his truest
> treasure was the sweetness of his face, kind enough for kissing. It didn’t
> belong here, but it wasn’t wrong. Or rather, it wasn’t what was wrong with the
> room. The poor thing was simply lost. Auri smiled and put the doll in her
> pocket with the crystal

Later we learn more. SROST:10:146:

> the design upon its shield. It was so faint. But yes. There was the tower
> wrapped up in a tongue of flame. No mere soldier, it was a small stone Amyr.
> Peering closer, Auri spied slight lines upon his arms as well. She did not
> know how she had missed these things before. It was a tiny Ciridae.

Notice, Auri, like kvothe has to look at the amyr twice before seeing it. It
would be odd if seeing had a certain calculus to it. Given Puppet suggests you can look too much.
Which given the strong, likelihood he is connected/is Selito's complicates matters even further. 
I had long wondered if Kvothe's first viewing hadn't been more true, but I doubtful Auri could
be deceived by anyone but herself.

Later Auri adds white tatted lace to the same pocket as the Amyr and Crystal. SROST:1:32

> she found a length of fine white tatted lace. She folded this up carefully and
> put it in her pocket with the crystal and the small stone soldier

The white tatted lace is likely related to Nettie William, Rike's mom. A
connection which, will I'll explain shortly. 

<img src="/img/bastandgirl.jpg" height="350px" width="210px" align="right">

Finally, Auri trades the Crystal for butter & honeycomb, when she leaves the
Crystal under the Lighting Tree near Rike's house. 

Relationships between the Farm Auri's visits (SROST) and the Williams Farm (TLT):

* The girl that see's Auri with her serious eye's is Nettie's daughter Tess.
* The same dog bay's at Auri and Bast
* Nettie has a trio of Goat's, Auri meets one or a relative.
* The honey that Auri takes is from Nettie, who has bee hives and also used it
  for candles.
* The farmhouse auri visits has a bearskin upon a rack to cure and Rikes father
  Jessom hunts and traps.
* Both Auri's farmhouse and the Williams have a garden
* Both locations have a barn
* The etymology of [Nettie](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nettie) is Net - tie, where net's are like tatted lace. 
  
This isn't the Cthaeh, so near a farm with milk, honey and curious eyes. This could possible
be the Sword Tree, but while the butter has knifes. Their are no mountains to
see, or swords. 

So then, The Lighting Tree. 

<img src="/img/lightingtree.jpeg" height="500px" width="300px">

---------------------------

<img src="/img/honeytree.jpg" height="500px" width="300px">

That being established, we must review the trade Auri makes for the honey. This happens in three parts:

1. Auri trades for the Nettie's butter & honeycomb for her White Tatted Lace. 
2. She is spotted by Tess, this increases the cost of the trade.
3. She leaves the cyrstal in the tree to pay the extra debt

---------

SROST:4:

1. trade. 

> Carefully she brought out the length of fine white tatted lace. She folded it
> and left it near the churn. It was the careful work of many long and drowsy
> autumn days. It would find purpose in a place like this. Then Auri took the
> clean white cloth that had held the hollyberry earlier and rubbed it with some
> butter.

Sense she only takes a bit of butter, lets just round this down to honeycomb.

<img src="/img/honey.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">

2. spotted. 

> a prickle on her neck told her that she was being watched... A little girl was watching her

3. debt paid 

> She cast her eyes around and saw a tree, a dark hole in its trunk ...

> The hole was perfect, just deep enough so that a little girl
> could reach inside and feel around. If she were curious, that is. If she were
> brave enough to stick her arm in nearly to her shoulder.

> Auri pulled the crystal from her pocket. She kissed it, brave explorer that it
> was, and lucky too. It was the perfect thing. This was the perfect place. True,
> she was no longer in the Underthing. But even so, this was so true it could not
> be denied. She wrapped the crystal in a leaf and lay it in the bottom of the
> hole. 

Does she mean for the girl to fall down the rabbit hole and go on mad fun
adventures? Or is this a bobble, a bait, a way to float her down into the
darkness.

<img src="/img/alice.jpeg" height="500px" width="300px">
<img src="/img/float.jpeg" height="500px" width="300px">

Finally, What use does our white tatted lace find? TLT:

> “I learned loads of things today, Reshi,” Bast protested. The
> innkeeper sat up, looking more attentive. “Really?” he said. “Impress me then.”
> Bast thought for a moment. “Nettie Williams found a wild hive of bees today,” he
> said. “And she managed to catch the queen …”

This is the end of the journey for the cyrstal, the begging of the honeycombs.

# The Light's Boundary

Auri use's the honeycomb and laurel fruit to make a candle for kvothe. Much could be said, here. 
Without elaborating, the ingredients are:

* laurel fruit 
* honey 
* perfect lavender 
* melting wax 
* daub of perfect pitch 
* auri breath in whistle 

Note, If the leaf kvothe swallowed on the Mauthen farm was the one Auri breathed on,
then her whistle is the second reference to her breath going in him. 

Auri find's that in the end she doesn't have time for the proper making of the candle, as too often is
the case, when she is pressed upon time, she turns to Boundry, she goes
beyond...

Candles feature predominantly in the narrative. 
Sometimes, they are obvious, though the tale is hard to [read](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/k7gnl1/inspecting_the_playing_cards/)

I see no mention of the candle after he receives it from auri. As far as I can
tell kvothe puts the candle in his box in Ankers. TWMF:50:358

In the interest of fairness I'll explain my idea here, rather then leave it to
poetry. Which implies i have some deep understanding here, which i don't. I
think both meanings to volatile are relevant here. The first being an
inclination to change rabidly, unpredictable, for the worse. Kvothe is certainly
that to some degree already. I suspect Auri is _deeply_ conflicted on shaping
him more so. The second meaning, that a substance is volatile if changes from
liquid to gas at low (say normal) temperature might be an explanation of how the
Seven are
[gas](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/evvie5/the_chandrian_signs_are_full_of_gas/),
and how move from place to place. NOTW:16:124

Auri was supposed to shape Kvothe to volatile, she _declined_. A small thing,
and yet it might make all the difference.

## Giving back

If you enjoyed this consider supporting Heifer International, either [directly](https://www.heifer.org/) through [worldbuilers](https://worldbuilders.org/).

A cause which Rothfuss, the orchestrate of all good and bad times had on Temerant, believes in.
And you should also buy all the Cool Worldbuilders KingKiller stuff, which really helps, um, build the world?

## Credits

Though the idea is mine and i take full responsible for any undo confusion, I
had help in piecing together bits here and there about the story from

* u/mattytangle, for deep knowing
* u/rhinatamorie, for kind words
* u/throwawaybreaks, for listening
* Yamus (on KKC discord), for careful criticism
* u/quoo, for Auri's soap
* u/aowshadow for a detailed review of this post
* u/biologin for the Rothuss alchemy quotes, and likely other bits i picked up
* u/mastersam for insights

They have some great KKC theories out there you should check out.

Thanks to the r/KingkillerChronicle and r/kkcwhiteboard. I'll be cutting back a lot on the time
I spend theory crafting, after i finish this, as i need to put my attention back on other matters.
But discovering the book anew and community was a much needed adventure in a dark time.

## Left over Questions

Here are some questions I jotted down but didn't try to answer which putting this together:

* Is bast somehow the suet that Auri takes with here?
* What are the White lace origins?
* What/where is Trumble? Is Newaree there?
* Is Aunt Sellie "ellie"? Elle on gravestone? A place where no men live?
* If the laurel tree is the borrow, what was the fruit? What does it imply?
* Is that a hawk in that farmer picture? We should back that claim with part of the story.

## TODO

* hare and fox : auri and kvothe
* newaree and mauthen farm
* true newaree location
* auri craft is fae
* auri "see a woman plate as snow" Pale Alenta brings the blight and what is the blight.
* auri does still the butter

## Citations

citations are as follows: Book:Chapter:page

Its likely the pages are inconstant between books.

* TWMF : The wise man's fears
* NOTW : Name of the Wind
* OH   : How old holly came to Be from "Unfettered"
* TLT  : The Lighting Tree from "Rouges"
* SROST: Slow Regard of Silent Things

Note i'll be citing the books OH and TLT by just Book::Page leaving out the
chapter sense each story is just one chapter itself

* RMVDD: Rick and Mortry vs Dugeons and Dragons
* TDDB : The Adventures of Mr. Whiffles and the Pinrcess in The Dark Deep Below

5. hollow
6. The angry dark
7. ash and ember
8. all to her desire
