## Prelude: A hand raised 

In short, this theory will cover Auri's candle making. In long...

The Kingkiller Chronicle's journey is powerful; it moves the heart. It's best if
you experience it yourself, rather than me rob you of the joy. Journey before
destination, and all that. In that vein allow me to tell a brief story
of a [boy who ran](/posts-output/2021-2-6-the-boy-who-ran) too fast. It is only an echo of the
stories told in Temerant, but hopefully it will dull the ache of waiting
for more stories from Rothfuss while appropriately setting the tone of the 
greater story I hope to unfold here.

In sort, I suggest you read around a *lot* before tackling this. That means all the
books a couple times, see the last section "Citations" for a list. It also means
spending some time on the forums. I'm not suggesting I have the right of things.
Or all of it. Instead, I'm saying it's a lot more fun to arrive at your own
conclusions before hearing others. So capital S Spoilers and possible BS ahead,
you decided which.

Enough of warnings, we look forward now, shadows on the horizon, drums in the
deep.

-----------

## Intro

The main theory is that Auri is Shaping Kvothes life from those of Lanre and
Selitos. To go further, I must be sure you understand as much about the Fae,
their magic, Waystones and Alchemy as possible. I'll give an overview of the
requirements in the next section "A careful look" then pick up the main theory
thread in the section titled "A Humerus Chandelier".

# A careful look

To understand the conclusion, that Auri is Shaping kvothe. You need to
understand the craft she uses to do it. Discussing the means, broadly speaking
_Fae magic_ and Alchemy. Are topics in there own right and so it's better to
break them out.

If your not sure how Fae do what they do, then here is a piece on [Fae
magic](/posts-output/2021-1-22-bitter-brew), where we learn from Bast and
observe him working his craft in the book "The Lighting Tree". Similarly, you
will need to have some understanding of [Alchemy](/posts-output/2021-1-23-alchemy) in order
Auri's candle making.

Most importantly, if you find your self in doubt that Auri is visiting *Newarre and the Mauthen farm* the read 
[How to get to Newarre](/posts-output/2021-1-15-how-to-get-to-newarre)
where I isolate the topic. I won't be covering that here, as it's too distracting

If you doubt that Auri could get there quickly, then
read [Ways to safe places](/posts-output/2021-1-23-ways-to-safe-places). Each
post will try to have summery or conclusion at the top. If you agree with it,
confidently move on.


# A Humerus Chandelier

<img src="/img/auri_honeycomb_c.jpg" height="500px" width="350px" >

Our theory is that Auri is shaping Kvothe From Lanre and Selitos, who are represented  by two items
she finds in the Underthing. To clarify, ill be keeping track of the items (what) and who in a table. The starting point,
which will explain shortly, is here:

 <table style="width:50%">
  <tr>
    <th>Who</th>
    <th>What</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lanre</td>
    <td>Arm Bone</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Selitos</td>
    <td>Crystal</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

...

We first need to establish how these items are like these figures. This is done multiple ways, mostly by association.

E.g If I said, my new boss sure is a bear. And later I said, he is really
grizzly today. We would count this as two connections from my boss to a bear.

The starting point for this theory happens in the repeated use of a single body part where typically it's counter would be
involved forms a pattern. There are two instances of this very close together
in the narrative. The more unusual of the two repeats itself when Lanre is described 
as having "strength of **arm**" rather then "strength of arms" NOWT:26:184:
   
> ..Lanre had the strength of his arm and the command of loyal men...

NOWT:26:187:

> ..his (Lanre) power lay in the strength of his arm. 

The second instance is also unusual, but also directly part of the plotline. And so receives
an understandable amount of attention.

NOWT:26:190:

> Selitos drew a deep breath. “By my eye I was deceived, never again....” He
> raised the stone and drove its needle point into his own eye.

NOTW:28:197:

> Selitos One-Eye stood forward and said, “Lord, if I do thi....

From here we are going to follow these items separately for a bit tell they come back together,
in different forms at the end.

# Breaking Bones

<img src="/img/bone.jpg" height="250px" width="250px"  vspace="20px" hspace="20px">

In Slow Regard of Silent Things (SROST), Auri finds a bone. SROST:1:24:

> she had found: a clean white bone.
> Long, but not a leg. An arm. The prima axial. She ran her fingers down the
> length of it and felt a tiny seam that ran all round it like a ring, showing it
> had broken and long-healed. It was full of pleasant shadows.


Here comes the analogies and metaphors we talked about before, were not going to
discuss why this is important now, rather just note the alike this bone the
"Prima Axial is" to Lanre:

1. The word axial is similar to Alaxel, who the Adem's song tells us is the lord of the Seven. 
2. prima  means "leading man" which Lanre certainly is.
3. "axial" isn't the name for any arm bone, but rather a collection of the middle parts of the body,
as shown [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_skeleton). Auri, who studied
at the university, would know this. 
4. The arm being broken and healed is to the Lanre being killed and raised
5. The arm being full of shadows is like Lanre being surrounded by shadows. 
6. In Vintish culture, a bone ring (see "tiny seam" from quote), indicates a profound and lasting debt, which Lanre has for his life returned.
7. That it's an arm bone, and he was known for his strength of arm.

Roughly seven associations. After retrieving the bone, Auri puts it near some holly, that she has on her.  SROST:1:24:

> The bone nestled almost indecently close to the holly berry. 

Holly is a topic all on it's own that I ramble about
[here](https://drewverlee.github.io/posts-output/2021-1-24-holly). You might
want to refer back to it later, for now lets move on. What Auri does next is
put, I would argue _trades_, the bone for Laurel Fruit, by placing the Bone
inside the Laurel Tree. SROST:4:70:

<img src="/img/gravetree.jpg" height="300px" width="300px">

> Auri reached into her gathersack and brought out the bone that she
> had found the day before. She bent down and tucked it deep inside the dark and
> hollow space beneath the tree. 

> Then she began to pick the small blue laurel fruit and put them in her gathersack as well.

I dive into if this could be the Latantha or the Cthaeh's tree
[here](https://drewverlee.github.io/posts-output/2021-1-14-gravetree). In the
end I chose the Mauthen Farm, because there is more evidence. A gentle reminder
that I cover the locations in detail in my post [How to get to
Newarre](/posts-output/2021-1-15-how-get-get-to-newarre).

<img src="/img/farmer.jpg" height="500px" width="350px">

More importantly, what is our little Auri doing at barrow-hill? Is she just
being cute whimsical harmless Auri? Dancing around seeing the proper ways of
things? Is this connected to some magic we have seen or have yet to see? I don't
recall an emphasis being put on any particular tree on the Farm, could the
Laurel tree represent something else to Auri? The barrow itself? Could it stand
for Kvothe's mother Laurel? What does it mean for the story? Will cover this at
the end, in the section "The Book of Secrets".

This is the end of the arm bone's journey, though it continues through the Laurel
Fruit which will pick up later. Next we will focus on the other item she finds,
a Crystal and the similarities its shares with Selitos.

# Crystal's and Blood

-----------------------------

<img src="/img/crystal.jpg" height="250px" width="250px">

Auri finds a Crystal in the Underthing. SROST:1:27:

> After a dozen steps, a glimmer on the marble floor caught her eye. Skipping
> close, she saw a crystal had fallen from the chandelier to lay unbroken on the
> floor. It was a lucky thing, and brave.

The Crystal is like the mountain glass Seltios used to stab his eye. The
relationship here is thin here, only that Crystal is similar to glass. But it's
immediately strengthened as the Crystal is put near a Ciridae doll. Given Selitos was the
founder of the Amyr, of whom the Ciridae were the highest rank, this gives us two connections to the lord of Myr Tariniel.

<img src="/img/Pairs_Commonwealth_Amyr.webp" height="400px" width="320px" >

Let's take a look at the relevant parts in SROST about the doll, just to show that
indeed, she calls it a Ciridae and groups it with the Crystal. SROST:1:28

> It was a tiny figurine carved from a piece of pale, retiring stone. A small
> soldier with clever lines to show his hauberk and his shield. But his truest
> treasure was the sweetness of his face, kind enough for kissing. It didn’t
> belong here, but it wasn’t wrong. Or rather, it wasn’t what was wrong with the
> room. The poor thing was simply lost. Auri smiled and put the doll in her
> pocket with the crystal

Later we learn more about the doll. SROST:10:146:

> the design upon its shield. It was so faint. But yes. There was the tower
> wrapped up in a tongue of flame. No mere soldier, it was a small stone Amyr.
> Peering closer, Auri spied slight lines upon his arms as well. She did not
> know how she had missed these things before. It was a tiny Ciridae.

After that, Auri adds white tatted lace to the same pocket as the Ciridae and Crystal. SROST:1:32

> she found a length of fine white tatted lace. She folded this up carefully and
> put it in her pocket with the crystal and the small stone soldier

The white tatted lace is likely symbolizes Nettie Williams, Rike's mom. 

<img src="/img/bastandgirl.jpg" height="350px" width="210px" align="right">

Finally, Auri trades the Crystal for the William's butter & honeycomb. She
leaves the Crystal under the Lighting Tree near the Williams house. For reasons only Auri 
can truly understand. Though later, will do our best to put it all together.

This Tree isn't the Cthaeh, so near a farm with milk, honey and curious eyes. This
could possible be the Sword Tree, but while the butter has knifes, their are no
mountains, mercenaries or swords to see.

So then, The Lighting Tree. 

<img src="/img/lightingtree.jpeg" height="500px" width="300px">

---------------------------

I gave an overview, but let me highlight the relevant sections in SROST where
Auri makes this trade. This happens in three parts:

1. Auri trades for the Nettie's butter & honeycomb for her White Tatted Lace. 
2. She is spotted by Tess, this increases the cost of the trade.
3. She leaves the cyrstal in the tree to pay the extra debt

---------

SROST:4:74

1. The trade:

> Carefully she brought out the length of fine white tatted lace. She folded it
> and left it near the churn. It was the careful work of many long and drowsy
> autumn days. It would find **purpose** in a place like this. Then Auri took the
> clean white cloth that had held the hollyberry earlier and rubbed it with some
> butter.

She only takes a bit of butter and the honeycomb.

<img src="/img/honey.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">

2. She is spotted by Tess. 

> a prickle on her neck told her that she was being watched... A little girl was watching her

3. The debt between them is now higher, Auri has to give a bit more:

> She cast her eyes around and saw a tree, a dark hole in its trunk ...

> The hole was perfect, just deep enough so that a little girl
> could reach inside and feel around. If she were curious, that is. If she were
> brave enough to stick her arm in nearly to her shoulder.

> Auri pulled the crystal from her pocket. She kissed it, brave explorer that it
> was, and lucky too. It was the perfect thing. This was the perfect place. True,
> she was no longer in the Underthing. But even so, this was so true it could not
> be denied. She wrapped the crystal in a leaf and lay it in the bottom of the
> hole. 

Does Auri mean for the girl go after this Crystal and fall down the rabbit hole.
Going on mad fun adventures with queens and Cheshire cats? Or is this a bobble,
a bait, a way to float her down into the maw of darkness.

<img src="/img/alice.jpeg" height="500px" width="300px">

Finally, what **purpose** does our white tatted lace find? TLT:

> “I learned loads of things today, Reshi,” Bast protested. The
> innkeeper sat up, looking more attentive. “Really?” he said. “Impress me then.”
> Bast thought for a moment. “Nettie Williams found a wild hive of bees today,” he
> said. “And she managed to catch the queen …”

I'll leave you to ponder the implications for now. This is the end of the
journey for the cyrstal, the begging of the honeycombs.

# A flickering look

 Auri use's the honeycomb and laurel fruit to make a candle for kvothe. Without elaborating, the ingredients are:

* laurel fruit 
* honey 
* perfect lavender 
* melting wax 
* daub of perfect pitch 
* auri breath in whistle 

Sought, brought and paid for. She brings what craft she possess to bare to
finish it just in time for him to arrive.

# Book of secrets

<img src="/img/book-of-secrets.webp" height="250px" width="250px">

So Auri took some items that I claim are like Selitos and Lanre and traded them
for some other items and then turned those into a candle which she gives kvothe.
What of it? _what does it all mean!_

Were barefoot and covered in darkness. A light breaks though the night clouds
and the road before us sparkles. It shimmers and shines, we draw sharp steal, we
prepare powerful magics. But nothing comes for us, there is only the path. Our
eyes adjust, the road is broken glass.

What comes next is no fairy tale. It's flesh and the [blood that lies beneath.](/posts-output/2021-2-11-below)

# Epilogue

## In a box

I see no mention of the candle after he receives it from Auri. 

> I came to my feet and she held out something wrapped in a piece of cloth. It was a thick candle that smelled of lavender. “What’s inside of it?” I asked. “Happy dreams,” she said. “I put them there for you.”

As far as I can tell kvothe puts the candle in his box in Ankers. TWMF:50:358

> I finished loading my travelsack, then packed everything else into the trunk that sat at the foot of my bed. A few worn tools, a broken piece of slate I used for ciphering, a small wooden box with the handful of small treasures Auri had given me....
