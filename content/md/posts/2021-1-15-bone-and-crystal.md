The theory is that the Arm bone  and cyrstal that Auri finds in the underthing are magically related 
to Lanre and Selitos respectively. 

Four points of clarification. 

1. I say magically related because it's unclear how, given my understanding of
the powers available, the are related. The narrator for SROST is Auri, so what
she is doing is skewed by her own mind. Her magic could be so deep and so
connected to the world that it defies careful exploration.

2. Second, This theory's strength comes not from one strong connection. But from
several weak ones. Like a spiders web, the net isn't ready tell there all in
place.

3. I'll be carving out non essential details in order to make this concise. I expect readers
to have combed the books many times and hopefully will do so here to help support or refute these claims. 
You should defiantly read around the quotes i pull. 

4. the relationship starting point is this:

Lanre   : arm bone
Selitos : crystal

As with any theory, we have to rely somewhat on metaphors. With
this theory, we rely only on these.

The repeated use of a single body part where typically it's counter would be
involved forms a patter. There are two instances of this very close together
in the narrative. The more unusual of the two repeats itself when Lanre is described 
as having "strength of arm" rather then "strength of arms"
   
> ... Lanre had the strength of his arm and the command of loyal men...

> ... his (Lanre) power lay in the strength of his arm. 

The second instance is also unusual, but is also directly part of the narrative. And so receives
an understandable amount of attention.

> Selitos One-Eye stood forward and said, “Lord, if I do thi....

> Selitos drew a deep breath. “By my eye I was deceived, never again....” He
> raised the stone and drove its needle point into his own eye.

From here we are going to follow these items separately, though as there
journeys are similar, they don't interact again. And the separation makes it
easier to keep track of the relationships that matter.

# Breaking Bones

<img src="/img/bone.jpg" height="250px" width="250px">


> she had found: a clean white bone.
> Long, but not a leg. An arm. The prima axial. She ran her fingers down the

> had broken and long-healed. It was full of pleasant shadows.

1. The word axial is similar to Alaxel.
2. prima means "leading man" which Lanre certainly is.
3. "axial" isn't the name for arm, but rather a collection of the middle parts of the body,
as shown [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_skeleton). Auri, who studied
at the university, would know this. Her naming is deliberate. She says _arm_ because he was known 
for his strength of _arm_. She says Axial, because it's close to his name.
4. The arm being broken and healed is to the Lanre being killed and raised
5. The arm being full of shadows is like Lanre being surrounded by shadows. 

The bone is put near holly:

> The bone nestled almost indecently close to the holly berry. 

6. The holly berry is a metaphor for creation. The Lady/Lyra uses it to bring
back Lanre in the form of Old Holly the warrior. For further exploration,
consult this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/krxwj0/lets_discuss_old_holly_berries_and_birth/), though it wasn't written with this in mind.

Auri visits a graveyard, where she puts, i would argue trades, the bone for Laurel Fruit, by putting the Bone 
under the Laurel Tree. 

> Auri reached into her gathersack and brought out the bone that she
> had found the day before. She bent down and tucked it deep inside the dark and
> hollow space beneath the tree. 

> Then she began to pick the small blue laurel fruit and put them in her gathersack as well.

I'm guessing your hoping i'll tell you which tree Lanre get's put in? Well, that ends
up being it's own post, where I stretch allegories to there limits. If you want to dive into that before
going on then by all means click [here](TODO)

This is the end of the the bone's story, though it contains through the Laurel which will pick up.


# Crystal's and Blood

-----------------------------

The Crystal is like the mountain glass seltios used to stab his eye. The
connection is thinner here, Crystal is similar to glass. What do we know about
"mountain glass"? However, the connection is immediately strengthened as The
cyrstal is put near an Amyr, give Selitos was their founder.

<img src="/img/Pairs_Commonwealth_Amyr.webp" height="500px" width="350px">


Here are the relevant parts about the Amyr doll:

> It was a tiny figurine carved from a piece of pale, retiring stone. A small
> soldier with clever lines to show his hauberk and his shield. But his truest
> treasure was the sweetness of his face, kind enough for kissing. It didn’t
> belong here, but it wasn’t wrong. Or rather, it wasn’t what was wrong with the

> pocket with the crystal

Later we learn more

> the design upon its shield. It was so faint. But yes. There was the tower
> wrapped up in a tongue of flame. No mere soldier, it was a small stone Amyr.
> Peering closer, Auri spied slight lines upon his arms as well. She did not
> know how she had missed these things before. It was a tiny Ciridae.

Later Auri adds white tatted lace to the same pocket as the Amyr and Crystal

> she found a length of fine white tatted lace. She folded this up carefully and
> put it in her pocket with the crystal and the small stone soldier

The white tatted lace is likely related to Nettie William, Rike's mom. A
connection which, will I'll explain shortly.


<img src="/img/bastandgirl.jpg" height="500px" width="300px">




Finally, Auri "trades" the Crystal for butter & honeycomb, when she leaves the
Crystal under the Lighting Tree near Rike's house.

Relationships between Auri's Farm and the Williams:

* The girl that see's Auri  with her serious eye's is Nettie's daughter Tess.
* The dog bay's are Auri and Bast
* Nettie has a trio of Goat's, Auri meets one.
* The honey that Auri takes is from Nettie, who has bee hives and also used it for candles.
* The etymology of [Nettie](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nettie) is Net - tie, where net's are like tatted lace. 

Finally, a lack of notable tree's that fit. This isn't the Cthaeh, so near a farm with milk and honey.
This could possible be the lighting tree, but while the butter has knifes. Their are no mountains to see.

So then, The Lighting Tree is in Tumbrel. I wasn't able to unravel anything from that, 
but more is there. I have no doubt.


<img src="/img/honeytree.jpg" height="500px" width="300px">

Returning, we must review the trade Auri makes. This happens in three parts:

1. Auri trads for the Nettie's butter & honeycomb for her White Tatted Lace. 
2. She is spotted by Tess, this increases the cost of the trade.
3. She leaves the cyrstal in the tree to pay the extra debt

1. trade

> Carefully she brought out the length of fine white tatted lace. She folded it
> and left it near the churn. It was the careful work of many long and drowsy
> autumn days. It would find purpose in a place like this. Then Auri took the
> clean white cloth that had held the hollyberry earlier and rubbed it with some
> butter.

Sense she only takes a bit of butter, lets just round this down to honeycomb.

<img src="/img/honey.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">

2. spotted

> a prickle on her neck told her that she was being watched... A little girl was watching her

3. debt paid 

> She cast her eyes around and saw a tree, a dark hole in its trunk ...

> The hole was perfect, just deep enough so that a little girl
> could reach inside and feel around. If she were curious, that is. If she were
> brave enough to stick her arm in nearly to her shoulder.

> Auri pulled the crystal from her pocket. She kissed it, brave explorer that it
> was, and lucky too. It was the perfect thing. This was the perfect place. True,
> she was no longer in the Underthing. But even so, this was so true it could not
> be denied. She wrapped the crystal in a leaf and lay it in the bottom of the
> hole. 

Does she mean for the girl to fall down the rabbit hole and go on mad fun
adventures? Or is this a bobble, a bait, a way to float her down into the
darkness.

This is the end of the journey for the cyrstal, the begging of the honeycombs.

# The Light's Boundary

-----------------------------

Auri use's the honeycomb and laurel fruit to make a candle for kvothe. 

Much could be said here, but I only eye one thing out of place as it were, Auri
falsely claims she doesn't have Camphor. 

In the end, as too often is the case, when Auri's is pressed upon time, she turns to Boundry, she goes beyond....

_and so she often finds a gentler way._

## Credits

Though the idea is mine, i had help in piecing together bits here and there 
about the story from u/mattytangle and Yamus (on discord). They have some 
great KKC theories out there you should check out. 

## Rights

All of the pictures are like property of Worldbuilders ,I have enjoyed my
purchases from them greatly and hope this isn't stepping on any toes.

## TODOS

5. clarify or clean up "magically related"
7. need more explanation on graveyard, iron fence, etc...
8. are the pine cones relevant?
9. Auri explicity mentions haven is far behind! what door would the masters have
   for her...
10. she like elodin, likes perfect acorns. jesus christ.
11. Check NOTW cards for the gravestone, i believe it says "ELLE". Is that the
    cat from P&W?
12. Check if the Cthaeh was a L
13. Is there anything to be learned in how she makes the candle?
14. Is where she found the bone and crystal really important? i mean, the pool
    is obviously ... idk.. everything? But the hallway with 12 doors might have
    a more specific meaning.
15. Both kvothe and auri have to look at the amyr twice. Is the first telling
    more true or is it the second? Is this like how seltios had to look at Lanre
    twice?
16. Double check auri didn't steal anything from the farmer. The butter? she closes the box, does she have some later?
THis would make the cyrstal a trade for something else.
17. Go check if Lighting Tree is near a farmhouse that can be seen? This doesn't prove anything as we have no idea the time frame but it would help.
18. look into bone rings and glass rings.
19. Auri vists old Trumble Nowhere is new dark Trumble is nowhere? Where was it then?
20. is bast the suet 

> I'm also curious if Bast isn't the Suet that Auri takes away with her, as he is compared to it.
>  a bit of a yelp, then he hit the ground like a sack of suet.

21. The White lace orgins
22. What/where is Trumble
23. is Aunt Sellie "ellie"? Elle on gravestone? A place where no men live?
