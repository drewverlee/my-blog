### Prelude: A hand raised 

In short, this theory will cover Auri's candle making. In long...

The Kingkiller Chronicle's journey is powerful; it moves the heart. It's best if
you experience it yourself, rather than me rob you of the joy. Journey before
destination, and all that.

So I suggest you read around a *lot* before tackling this. That means all the
books, see the last section "Citations" for a complete list. It also means some
time on the forums. I'm not suggesting I have the right of things. Instead, I'm
saying it's a lot more fun to arrive at your own conclusions before hearing
others. So capital S Spoilers and possible BS ahead, you decided which. Enough
of warnings, we look forward now, shadows on the horizon, drums in the deep.


-----------


The main theory is that Auri is shaping Kvothes life from those of Lanre and Selitos. 

To go further, I must be sure you understand as much about the Fae, their magic
and alchemy's as possible. Which is to say, we know next to nothing of the full
picture. We must also establish that Auri is Fae, and that she knows alchemy,
and she can reach the Mauthen Farm. If you wish to accept these as facts, you
may safely skip to "A careful look", a tomb in its own right, and its
subsections and go right to "A humerous chandelier" where the main theory picks
up.


## A careful look


Here we need to split up topics so we can digest them, and then merge them back together a bit.

* Arts and Craft time: fae magic
* Alchemy: 
* Double Trouble: Alchemy is fae magic

Each section will have summery at the top. If you agree with it, confidently move on. 

### Arts and Craft time:

#### Summary

There are three types of fae craft:

 <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Translation</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Example</th

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Glammourie</td>
    <td>Seeming</td>
    <td>Change how things look</td>
    <td>make you think a torn shirt seem like it was whole</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Grammarie</td>
    <td>Being</td>
    <td>Change how things feel</td>
    <td>make you love a torn shirt like your father gave it to you</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>Grammorie</td>
    <td>Shaping</td>
    <td>Change how things feel and seem </td>
    <td>make you love a torn shirt like a whole shirt your father gave you</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

More importantly fae craft works though the impressions.

#### Bitter Brew

I know its asking a lot, but likely a partial re-read of the lighting tree is in order. You would do yourself a huge dis-service to not have at
least read it once before going further. So lets hear what bast has to say about fae _magic_.

<img src="/img/bastvine.jpg" height="500px" width="350px">
 

Bast, tells us, when talking to Kostrel,  directly of two types of magic the fae do. TLT::742:

> “Okay. Here’s the bones of what I know. They don’t think of it as magic. They’d never use that
> term. They’ll talk of art or craft. They talk of seeming or shaping.” He looked
> up at the sun and pursed his lips. “But if they were being frank, and they are
> rarely frank, mind you, they would tell you almost everything they do is either
> glammourie or grammarie. Glammourie is the art of making something seem.
> Grammarie is the craft of making something be.” 



Kostrel cleverly deduces that these two _crafts_ could be used together

> “Can you use glammourie and grammarie at the same time?”

I playful dub this "ising" but more likely you know it by another name. _Shaping_

Though this is never given a name, I suspect it to be _glammorie_. The root being _g*am_ being craft/art/magic while the later half _morie_ being clarifying what type. The differences in the root words _gram_ and _glam_ relate to how there used. _gram_ means measure, which you have to do when doing _grammarie_. _glam_ is akin _charm_ as in, your performance matters in the potency of the craft. So back to my guess of _glammorie_. I'm not sure of the root really, but the reason for _morie_ is from working backwards from the words chiseled above the doors to the archives. NOTW:TODO:TODO.

> As I approached the Archives, its grey, windowless surface reminded me of an
> immense greystone. It was hard to believe after all the years of waiting that
> I was finally there. I circled around it until I found the entrance, a massive
> pair of stone doors standing wide open. Over them, chiseled deep into the
> stone, were the words Vorfelan Rhinata Morie. I didn’t recognize the language.
> It wasn’t Siaru ... maybe Yllish, or Temic. Yet another question I needed
> answers for.

Wil gives us his translation. WMF:13:TODO:

> “The desire for knowledge shapes a man,” he said. “Or something close to that.”

Rhinata shares a common root with Rhinna, a flower and panacea. As well as Rhinta, which the Tempi explains is a "bad thing". TMWF:TODO:TODO

> “A bad thing. A man who is more than a man, yet less than a man.”

I can't confidently break down Vorefelan, but i suspect given how its used on the archives, wil's translation and how the word "avoi" is used by the Skindancer that "vo" is close to "want" or "desire". 

So I purpose roughly that Vorefelan is desire and knowledge, Rhinata is the man
who is changed and _Morie_ could fit as shaping. Note, _morie_ being _shaping_
isn't necessary for the main theory. But It will allow us to communicate easier.

So we have words and a rough outline

* Glammourie: Seeming
* Grammarie : Being
* Grammorie : Ising /shaping 

We also need to build a sense for these things. First off, the list of above also indicates ease of use. 
As an example of the first, Bast tell us that turning led into gold
is glammourie/seeming. Bast explains in TLT:

> “Glammourie is easier (then grammarie). They can make a thing seem other than it is. They could make a white shirt seem
> like it was blue. Or a torn shirt seem like it was whole. Most of the folk have
> at least a scrap of this art. Enough to hide themselves from mortal eyes. If
> their hair was all of silver-white, their glammourie could make it look as black
> as night.”

Note that "Silver-white to black as night" would work in reverse. Likely, this works
with eye color as well. Colors are easier to change then the feelings those eyes
invoke.

So the more alike things are, and the better you are at understanding them, the more easily you can use glammourie to 
make them seem similar.  A cook of some skill can substitute ingredients with some ease and convince everyone
nothing was amiss as long as they know the chemistry.

Grammarie is harder for bast to describe:

> Grammarie is about …shifting. It’s about making something into more of what it already is.”

i'll summarize, this is growing to large as it is and let you disagree based on your own findings. In short,
Grammarie is about changing the feelings people have about something. Bast uses
the example of applying the sentimental value Krostrel feels towards his knife,
to any knife, such that anyone that looks on it feels that way. It's making
taking the metaphysical feelings we apply to things and transferring them as if
they were attributes. A modern day example is when a young beautiful woman
smiles at you while a list of side effects from a medication scroll down a page.
Those things are _not_ related, but the company would dearly love it if you
believed it was so.

Finally, Grammorie. To change how something seems and how people feel about it. We have to guess here, do we say this truly changes it? Or do we say 
that it puts it in a prefect prison? Is there a meaningful difference between the two?

To the last I say there isn't. to observers, but there might be to the larger
world. I'll leave you to ponder what it means.

Let's see at least one of the fae craft in action. A dark example, but one that its
worth understanding because will come back to it full circle in the end.

In the TLT, Rike says he will repay Bast triple for sending Jassom, his father, far away, so he can't hurt (physically and emotionally) his 
family anymore. Bast agrees and asks him for river stone

> Bast pointed at the stream. “Find a river stone with a hole in it and bring it to me.

But the physical item it self isn't all that matters, but the finding matters to:

> “You have to be the one to find it,” he said. “It can’t be anyone else. And you need to find it dry on the shore.

Bast then asks for a needle.

> “Now we need a needle. But it has to be borrowed from a house where no men live.”

But not just any needle. 

“Old Nan don’t like me none,” he said. “But I reckon she’d give me a pin.”

And again, how its acquired matters:

> “And you have to borrow it. You can’t steal it or buy it. She has to lend it to you.”

Between Rike finding the pin and returning, Bast seduces Rike's mother Nettie
and they sing a song together, I think you know the tune. Sometime Later Bast is limping, he claims 
he was attacked by a bear. He smells of liquor. Jessom put up a fight and hurt bast with the bottle of liquor he had, 
but in the end Bast, ran Jassom off the hill. Quite litterly, he controled his body and ran him off the hill. The towns bicker about what happen, but they all agree he fell off LittleCliff and he was drunk. As Old Cob explains. TLT:TODO:

> “It weren’t a cougar,” he insisted. “He was drunk off his feet. That’s what I heard. Stumbling-lost drunk. That’s the only sense of it.

TODO

So after Bast spends time with Rike's mother, but before he "chases" Jassom off
the cliff. Rike returns with the needle. Bast leads him to the greystone, the
location matters. He tells rick that to send his father away, Rike must drop his
blood, because its like his fathers, through the river stone. Bast mentions this
wouldn't work on an animal because it only desires, the magic only work on those
that have empathy, think ahead, that are civilized. He also says the charm will only work 
for one person and is startled when Bast demand that me his mother because he is worried that
he will be wrong like his father. It's worth feeling this moment. This is no
fairy tale, this is flesh and blood with bone beneath:

> “He’ll go far away. You have my word—” “NO!” Rike said, his face going red and
> angry. “What if sending him isn’t enough? What if I grow up like my da? I get
> so …” His voice choked off, and his eyes started to leak tears. “I’m not good.
> I know it. I know better than anyone. Like you said. I got his blood in me.
> She needs to be safe from me. If I grow up twisted up and bad, she needs the
> charm to … she needs something to make me go a—” Rike clenched his teeth,
> unable to continue. Bast reached out and took hold of the boy’s shoulder. He
> was stiff and rigid as a plank of wood, but Bast gathered him in and put his
> arms around his shoulders. Gently, because he had seen the boy’s back. They
> stood there for a long moment, Rike stiff and tight as a bowstring, trembling
> like a sail tight against the wind. “Rike,” Bast said softly. “You’re a good
> boy. Do you know that?” The boy bent then, sagged against Bast and seemed like
> he would break himself apart with sobbing. His face was pressed into Bast’s
> stomach and he said something, but it was muffled and disjointed. Bast made a
> soft crooning sound of the sort you’d use to calm a horse or soothe a hive of
> restless bees. The storm passed, and Rike stepped quickly away...



This moment might be the hinge on which the world turns. Bast 
decides to split the cost with Rike and add his blood to the pact. But more then that
he tells a pretty lie to assure Rike that he wont be like his father:

> “When you give it to her, you have to tell her that you made it for her because you love
> her.” The boy looked uncomfortable, as if he were trying to swallow a stone.
> “It’s essential for the magic,” Bast said firmly. “And then, if you want to make
> the magic stronger, you need to tell her every day. Once in the morning and once at night.”

Then Rike and Bast put a drop of blood through the stone:

> Rike braced the stone with his other hand. Bast turned his finger, and the
> drop of blood hung in the air for a moment before falling straight through the
> hole to strike the greystone underneath. There was no sound. No stirring in the
> air. No distant thunder. If anything, it seemed there was a half second of
> perfect brick-heavy silence in the air. But it was probably nothing more than a
> brief pause in the wind. 

Finally, Bast tells him to rub the wax (honeycomb) into the stone and stay with
the stone on a high hill until sunset fades:

> “Is that it?” Rike asked after a moment, clearly
> expecting something more. “Yup,” Bast said, licking the blood from his finger
> with a red, red tongue. Then he worked his mouth a little and spat out the wax
> he had been chewing. He rolled it between his fingers and handed it to the boy.
> “Rub this into the
> stone, then take it to the top of the highest hill you can find. Stay there
> until the last of the sunset fades, and then give to her tonight.”

Note he had promised the honey comb to a girl in the village, if she would bring him twenty perfect acorns. 


What goes into fae magic?  Honey wax, River Stones, and Blood? No. Those are simple
things, Teccam tells us the true cost. TWMF:

> It’s like what Teccam wrote, ‘The cost of a loaf is a simple thing, and so a loaf is often sought ...’
> but some things are past valuing: laughter, land, and love are never bought.

It's important that you form an opion about how Fae magic works before going further. So that when you see it
again latter, you have some sense of what your seeing. The physical ingredients are not the fuel, its _feeling_ the _being_
of the things. What they Stand for, who found them and what they mean to them. Angry rocks, happy honey.


### Alchemy

We know very little about Alchemy at this point, because young kvothe knows little about alchemy. Simmon actually makes him say it. TMWF:TODO

> “Okay,” Sim said, exasperated. “You need to shut up and listen. This is alchemy. You know nothing about alchemy.”
> I made a placating gesture. “I know. I know.”
> “Say it, then. Say, ‘I know nothing about alchemy.’ ”
> I glowered at him.

When kvothe gets exposed to Plum Bob we get a glimpse of how it can be used, as kvothe seems to lose all foresight and empathy. TODO:

> “How about this?” Simmon asked me. “Which is worse, stealing a pie or killing Ambrose?”
> I gave it a moment’s hard thought. “A meat pie, or a fruit pie?”
> “Wow,” Fela said breathlessly.

 So Alchemy can alter your state of mind. This is just an example though, it hardly gives us an idea of the scope or how its done. Well we have two more sources. First, apparently, in a rare mood, 
Rothfuss himself chimed in according to this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/kkcwhiteboard/comments/kjmud2/this_is_alchemy_you_know_nothing_about_alchemy/ggyq9go?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):

> Alchemy is a process of extracting like platonic forms from objects. So you can pull the drunkenness from wine, and have it, and put it in something else. Or you could just take the wine and pull the hangover out of it.

[Platonic forms](https://owlcation.com/humanities/An-Introduction-to-Platos-Theory-of-Forms) is likely a reference to an idea put form by Plato that idealizations really exist.

> The Platonic Forms, according to Plato, are just ideas of things that actually exist. They represent what each individual thing is supposed to be like in order for it to be that specific thing.

Finding out which view of a philosophy Rothfuss had in mind, and then applying it the series, would be a good way to end up crocked. It seems Alchemy lets you extract how something makes people feel (litterly and physically) from an object. So you might be able to extract a bit of sadness form an a overcooked steak. But you could probably extract a lot of anger from idk Hitlers hat, because so many people there energy at it.

Finally, Auri does alchemy, but sense the Alchemy she does is part of the main theory were going to ave it tell the end.






#### Summary

TODO

### TODO

Simmon tells us Alchemy isn't like Chemistry. NOTW:

> Simmon laughed. “Everyone thinks chemistry and alchemy are so similar, but they’re really not. They’re not even related. They just happen to live in the same house.”


### Double Trouble

Recall Bast tells us that the Fae call what they do _art_ and _craft_

Auri does craft

TODO

She calls Alchemy art. SROST:

> Whoever wrought and factored this was living proof that alchemy was art.


# A Humerus Chandelier

<img src="/img/auri_honeycomb_c.jpg" height="500px" width="350px" align="right">

PICKUP

The theory is that the Arm bone and Cyrstal that Auri finds in the Underthing are related 
to Lanre and Selitos respectively.

Four points of clarification:

TODO fix this, we know how now.
1. I say simply _related_ because it's unclear how, and for the purposes of the bulk of
this theory, the concern is to prove how alike they are through story and metaphor. Will
leave it to the very ending to speculate on what it means.

2. This theory's strength comes not from one strong connection. But from
several weak ones. Like a spiders web, the trap isn't ready tell it's fully woven. 

3. I'll be carving out non essential details in order to make this concise. I expect readers
to have combed the books many times and hopefully will do so here to help support or refute these claims. You should defiantly read around the quotes I pull. 

4. the relationships starting point is this:


---------------

 <table style="width:50%">
  <tr>
    <th>Who</th>
    <th>What</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lanre</td>
    <td>Arm Bone</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Selitos</td>
    <td>Crystal</td>
  </tr>
</table> 



---------------

As a starting point, the repeated use of a single body part where typically it's counter would be
involved forms a pattern. There are two instances of this very close together
in the narrative. The more unusual of the two repeats itself when Lanre is described 
as having "strength of **arm**" rather then "strength of arms" NOWT:26:184:
   
> ... Lanre had the strength of his arm and the command of loyal men...

NOWT:26:187:

> ... his (Lanre) power lay in the strength of his arm. 

The second instance is also unusual, but also directly part of the plotline. And so receives
an understandable amount of attention.

NOWT:26:190:

> Selitos drew a deep breath. “By my eye I was deceived, never again....” He
> raised the stone and drove its needle point into his own eye.

NOTW:28:197:

> Selitos One-Eye stood forward and said, “Lord, if I do thi....

From here we are going to follow these items separately for a bit tell they come back together,
in different forms at the end.

# Breaking Bones
<img src="/img/bone.jpg" height="250px" width="250px" align="center" vspace="20px" hspace="20px">

In Slow Regard of Silent Things (SROST), Auri finds a bone. SROST:1:24:

> she had found: a clean white bone.
> Long, but not a leg. An arm. The prima axial. She ran her fingers down the
> length of it and felt a tiny seam that ran all round it like a ring, showing it
> had broken and long-healed. It was full of pleasant shadows.

Let us say how this "Prima Axial" is like Lanre:

1. The word axial is similar to Alaxel, who the Adem's song tells us is the lord of the Seven. 
2. prima  means "leading man" which Lanre certainly is.
3. "axial" isn't the name for any arm bone, but rather a collection of the middle parts of the body,
as shown [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_skeleton). Auri, who studied
at the university, would know this. Her naming is deliberate. She says _arm_ because he was known 
for his strength of _arm_. 
4. The arm being broken and healed is to the Lanre being killed and raised
5. The arm being full of shadows is like Lanre being surrounded by shadows. 
6. In Vintish culture, a bone ring (see "tiny seam" from quote), indicates a profound and lasting debt, which Lanre has for his life returned.

After retrieving the bone, Auri puts it near holly at some point. SROST:1:24:

> The bone nestled almost indecently close to the holly berry. 

Holly is a topic all on it's own and so deserves some consideration.

## Holly 

I believe holly berry is a metaphor for creation. The Lady/Lyra uses it to bring
back Lanre in the form of Old Holly the warrior. For further exploration,
consult this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/krxwj0/lets_discuss_old_holly_berries_and_birth/), though it wasn't written with this in mind.

Holly is what the Sithe wear when they ride out hunting skin dancers, so we presume it has some protective powers

<img src="/img/sithe.webp" height="400px" width="250px" align="right">

Bast tells us the Sithe guard the Cthaeh, and treat anyone who comes in contact
with it like a disease they need to burn out of this world. Kvothe casual walked
up to it however, so something is amiss.I like to think they allowed it.
Furthermore and that they are shooting down the butterflies. Butterflies
pollinate, which help plants reproduce, by moving the male bits to the female bits on
another plant. So is kvothe a pollinature of another sort? Felurian doesn't
think he is bitten, but she doesn't look to hard. And she is a bit of a twilight
flower, if you will excuse the expression, herself.

Holly is also features predominantly in How Old Holly came to be OH:

> Old Holly bent his boughs again, and brought a spear, its wood of living green. Its blade as bright as berry blood. This he drove into...

And has implications for our tired Inn Keeper. WMF:2:423

> The innkeeper ’s fingers fumbled clumsily, snapping the holly branch and jabbing a thorn deep into the fleshy part of his thumb. The red-haired man didn’t flinch or curse, just scowled angrily down at his hand as a bead of blood welled up, bright as a berry.

Will say more about holly later, but for now lets move Auri's journey forward as she visits a graveyard.

##  Bones and Berries

<img src="/img/gravetree.jpg" height="300px" width="300px">


There she puts, I would argue _trades_, the bone for Laurel Fruit, by placing the Bone 
inside the Laurel Tree. SROST:4:70:

> Auri reached into her gathersack and brought out the bone that she
> had found the day before. She bent down and tucked it deep inside the dark and
> hollow space beneath the tree. 

> Then she began to pick the small blue laurel fruit and put them in her gathersack as well.

I dive into if this could be the sword tree or the Cthaeh's tree [here](https://drewverlee.github.io/posts-output/2021-1-14-gravetree). But ill summarize:

1. Auri described the Tree as lonely, which suits the Cthaeh very well. WMF:104:685:

> And as I ran I could hear Cthaeh speaking behind me. Its dry, quiet voice
> followed me longer than I would have thought possible. “Come back. Come back.
> I’ve more to say. I’ve so much more to tell you, won’t you stay?”

2. The Cthaeh's dead butterfly's are like a graveyard.
3. At a long stretch, I think Kvothe will lay waste to Hearth trying to get to
   Cinder who I believe he will find there, thus making it a graveyard.
   So then the Adems stone houses as analogous to gravestones in two ways, which 
   only work based on a theory I haven't substantiated.
4. Only English/Cherry Laurel's have dark blue fruit in reality. That isn't the
   tree featured in the book. It's possible someone: Pat or Auri is confused. It's
   possible Auri was picking up the berries from the Ivy, which might make it
   a Hedra _Helix_, which is a type of Ivy. The name of which is lose to Haliax. But word similarity is a
   too thin to base an idea on alone
5. The Sword Tree fits Lanre better, who was known for his sword prowess.
6. Both Felurian and the Adem have _Ivy and Oak_ in their _art_, The Laurel tree
   with blue fruit isn't an oak, But there is a tree known as Laurel Oak that is
   hard to tell apart from an oak.
7. Kovthe, when he won his talent pipes singing "The Lay of Sir Savien Traliard" compares Saviens voice to a "rock-old oak". 

NOTW:44:

> And we sang! Her voice like burning silver, my voice an echoing answer. Savien sang solid, powerful lines, like branches of a rock-old oak, all the while Aloine was like a nightingale, moving in darting circles around the proud limbs of it.


Except, it's him singing. So we might say kvothe considers himself an Oak.

8. Auri has ivory skin and Cinder has Ivory teeth, which might indicate an
addition of some sort. The obvious guess is Denner Resin, But i wonder if it isn't 
Trillium, which kvothe calls Denna, which Felurian eats. aka _birthroot_:

<img src="/img/trill.jpeg" height="300px" width="300px">

For me, If it has to be one of the two prime tree's, the Latantha is closer.
However, graveyard and lonely make it nearly a tie. In the end, i suspect *waves
hands* the tree's roots are linked. A theory I hope to cover _any day now_. 

<img src="/img/anydaynow.jpg" height="400px" width="250px">

But let's have a taste shall we?

Celtic Mythology paints a picture of two who are one, but at war, warring with
against each other, warring with themselves. The Oak and Holly. During Midsummer
the Oak King is at the height of strength, the Holly king regains power at the
Autumn equinox, his power peaking at midwinter, at which point the oak king is
reborn.

<img src="/img/hollyoak.jpeg" height="300px" width="400px">

Guess who else dabbles in duality's?

<img src="/img/summersoap.webp" height="225px" width="300px">
<img src="/img/perfectsoap.jpeg" height="225px" width="300px">

Later, you might want to read  u/quoo's master piece theory on
Auri's [soap](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/48jv6c/kkc_spoilers_all_the_allegory_of_auris_magnum/),

I'm not suggesting that Celtic Mythology plays a role here, The Four
Corners has it's own lore. For one It's Ivy climbing Oak, Holly isn't an Ivy.

I'm just i'm highlighting that such devices are part of our blood, our very
creation, a topic I tried to capture in
[*story and art*](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wkduktjjd5rc1gq/Story.pdf?dl=0). Here is a
sample of some of roaring heart wilting poetry i spin into being:

<img src="/img/blackwhite.png" height="200px" width="400px" style="border: 5px solid #8B0000;">

### Farms, Hawks and rabbits

<img src="/img/farmer.jpg" height="500px" width="350px">

Coming back to the main theory, The Mauthen farm has some strong similarities as well:

* The Barrows are a grave/bone yard, the pig farmer mentions the Mathen's dug up bones.
* The Oak trees at the farm could be responsible for 
* Auri finds pine cones in the area, The Farm has pine trees which could leave them.
* The Farm is said to have a "stone outcropping", which might be gravestones auri sees.
* They both have mushrooms.
* The leaf Auri breaths on could be the one Kvothe swallows. 
* The graveyard Ivy could be how The Denner Tree's near the farm make addicts teeth white. 
* The Iron fense from the graveyard could be the Iron Wheel in Town near the farm
* Verinan, who kvothe compares to a _Verinan_ red flower, could be the graveyard rose.


So if this is the Mauthen farm whats the lesson? Is the Laurel Tree the barrow itself?
What does it mean for the story? 

This is the end of the arm bone's story, though it contains through the Laurel Fruit which will pick up later.

# Crystal's and Blood

-----------------------------

<img src="/img/crystal.jpg" height="250px" width="250px">

Auri finds a Crystal in the Underthing. SROST:1:27:

> After a dozen steps, a glimmer on the marble floor caught her eye. Skipping
> close, she saw a crystal had fallen from the chandelier to lay unbroken on the
> floor. It was a lucky thing, and brave.

The Crystal is like the mountain glass seltios used to stab his eye. The
connection is thin here, only that Crystal is similar to glass. What do we
know about "mountain glass"? However, the connection is immediately strengthened
as The Crystal is put near an Amyr, given Selitos was their founder.

<img src="/img/Pairs_Commonwealth_Amyr.webp" height="500px" width="350px" align="right">

Here are the relevant parts about the Amyr doll. SROST:1:28

Later we learn more. SROST:10:146:

> the design upon its shield. It was so faint. But yes. There was the tower
> wrapped up in a tongue of flame. No mere soldier, it was a small stone Amyr.
> Peering closer, Auri spied slight lines upon his arms as well. She did not

Notice, Auri, like kvothe has to look at the amyr twice before seeing it. It
would be odd if seeing had a certain calculus to it. Given Puppet suggests you can look too much.
Which given the strong, likelihood he is connected/is Selito's complicates matters even further. 
I had long wondered if Kvothe's first viewing hadn't been more true, but I doubtful Auri could
be deceived by anyone but herself.

Later Auri adds white tatted lace to the same pocket as the Amyr and Crystal. SROST:1:32

> she found a length of fine white tatted lace. She folded this up carefully and
> put it in her pocket with the crystal and the small stone soldier

The white tatted lace is likely related to Nettie William, Rike's mom. A
connection which, will I'll explain shortly. 

<img src="/img/bastandgirl.jpg" height="350px" width="210px" align="right">

Finally, Auri trades the Crystal for butter & honeycomb, when she leaves the
Crystal under the Lighting Tree near Rike's house. 

Relationships between the Farm Auri's visits (SROST) and the Williams Farm (TLT):

* The girl that see's Auri  with her serious eye's is Nettie's daughter Tess.
* The same dog bay's at Auri and Bast
* Nettie has a trio of Goat's, Auri meets one.
* The honey that Auri takes is from Nettie, who has bee hives and also used it for candles.
* The etymology of [Nettie](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nettie) is Net - tie, where net's are like tatted lace. 
* The farmhouse auri visits has a bearskin upon a rack to cure and Rikes father Jessom hunts and traps.
  
This isn't the Cthaeh, so near a farm with milk and honey. This could possible
be the Sword Tree, but while the butter has knifes. Their are no mountains to
see. 

So then, The Lighting Tree. 

<img src="/img/lightingtree.jpeg" height="500px" width="300px">

---------------------------

<img src="/img/honeytree.jpg" height="500px" width="300px">

That being established, we must review the trade Auri makes for the honey. This happens in three parts:

1. Auri trades for the Nettie's butter & honeycomb for her White Tatted Lace. 
2. She is spotted by Tess, this increases the cost of the trade.
3. She leaves the cyrstal in the tree to pay the extra debt

---------

SROST:4:

1. trade.

Sense she only takes a bit of butter, lets just round this down to honeycomb.

<img src="/img/honey.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">

2. spotted. 

> a prickle on her neck told her that she was being watched... A little girl was watching her

3. debt paid

Does she mean for the girl to fall down the rabbit hole and go on mad fun
adventures? Or is this a bobble, a bait, a way to float her down into the
darkness.

Finally, What use does our white tatted lace find? TLT:

> “I learned loads of things today, Reshi,” Bast protested. The
> innkeeper sat up, looking more attentive. “Really?” he said. “Impress me then.”

This is the end of the journey for the cyrstal, the begging of the honeycombs.

# The Light's Boundary

Auri use's the honeycomb and laurel fruit to make a candle for kvothe. Much could be said, here. 
Without elaborating, the ingredients are:

* laurel fruit 
* honey 
* perfect lavender 
* melting wax 
* daub of perfect pitch 
* auri breath in whistle 

Note, If the leaf kvothe swallowed on the Mauthen farm was the one Auri breathed on,
then her whistle is the second reference to her breath going in him. 

Auri find's that in the end she doesn't have time for the proper making of the candle, as too often is
the case, when she is pressed upon time, she turns to Boundry, she goes
beyond...

## In a box


I see no mention of the candle after he receives it from auri. As far as I can
tell kvothe puts the candle in his box in Ankers. TWMF:50:358

In the interest of fairness I'll explain my idea here, rather then leave it to
poetry. Which implies i have some deep understanding here, which i don't. I
think both meanings to volatile are relevant here. The first being an
inclination to change rabidly, unpredictable, for the worse. Kvothe is certainly
that to some degree already. I suspect Auri is _deeply_ conflicted on shaping
him more so. The second meaning, that a substance is volatile if changes from
liquid to gas at low (say normal) temperature might be an explanation of how the
Seven are
[gas](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/evvie5/the_chandrian_signs_are_full_of_gas/),
and how move from place to place. NOTW:16:124

Auri was supposed to shape Kvothe to volatile, she _declined_. A small thing,
and yet it might make all the difference.

If you enjoyed this consider supporting Heifer International, either [directly](https://www.heifer.org/) through [worldbuilers](https://worldbuilders.org/).

A cause which Rothfuss, the orchestrate of all good and bad times had on Temerant, believes in.
And you should also buy all the Cool Worldbuilders KingKiller stuff, which really helps, um, build the world?

## Credits

Though the idea is mine and i take full responsible for any undo confusion, I
had help in piecing together bits here and there about the story from

* u/mattytangle, for deep knowing
* u/rhinatamorie, for kind words
* u/throwawaybreaks, for listening
* Yamus (on KKC discord), for careful criticism
* u/quoo, for Auri's soap
* u/aowshadow for a detailed review of this post

They have some great KKC theories out there you should check out.

Thanks to the r/KingkillerChronicle and r/kkcwhiteboard. I'll be cutting back a lot on the time
I spend theory crafting as i need to put my attention back on other matters.
But I discovering the book anew and community was a needed adventure. 

## Left over Questions

Here are some questions I jotted down but didn't try to answer which putting this together:

* Is bast somehow the suet that Auri takes with here?
* What are the White lace origins?
* What/where is Trumble? Is Newaree there?
* Is Aunt Sellie "ellie"? Elle on gravestone? A place where no men live?
* If the laurel tree is the borrow, what was the fruit? What does it imply?
* Is that a hawk in that farmer picture? We should back that claim with part of the story.

## TODO

* hare and fox : auri and kvothe
* newaree and mauthen farm
* true newaree location
* auri craft is fae

## Rights

All (most) of the pictures are likely property of Worldbuilders ,I have enjoyed my
purchases from them greatly and hope using them this isn't stepping on any toes.
