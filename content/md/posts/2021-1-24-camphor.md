## Camphor

_In the end, they were all of them deceived_

_For though they knew the safe and prideful path._

_Their hearts new true._ 

_And so as they turned their heads once in wrong,_ 

_they turned again to renew:_

In the interest of fairness I'll explain my idea here, rather then leave it to
poetry. Which implies i have some deep understanding here, which i don't. I
think both meanings to volatile are relevant here. The first being an
inclination to change rabidly, unpredictable, for the worse. Kvothe is certainly
that to some degree already. I suspect Auri is _deeply_ conflicted on shaping
him more so. The second meaning, that a substance is volatile if changes from
liquid to gas at low (say normal) temperature might be an explanation of how the
Seven are
[gas](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/evvie5/the_chandrian_signs_are_full_of_gas/),
and how move from place to place. NOTW:16:124

Auri was supposed to shape Kvothe to volatile, she _declined_. A small thing,
and yet it might make all the difference.
