### Intro

A prerequisite for enjoying and understanding this theory is
that you have read several books that used to bring it together: 

* Name of the Wind (NOTW)
* The Wise Mans Fears (TWMF)
* The Lighting Tree (TLT) 
* The Slow Regard of Silent Things (SROST). 

It would also help to have read "History of Tak", but it isn't strictly necessary.

Without careful inspection of each of these books, most of this theory will be
confusing or worse, ruin the fun for you. Ideally, any reader considers
themselves well versed in KKC lore and feel there are few if any doors left to
open before book three is released. Put frankly, _spoilers_ or _fan fiction_
ahead. You decide which!


----

The theory is that Newarre is near Trebon and the Mauthen farm. The idea relies
on several elements that will discuss individually, either here, or in other
posts which I'll link to. The bulk of this theory is a piece of another titled
[Warren Widdershins Ways and Woes](/posts-output/2021-1-15-bone-and-crystal)
in which Auri gets the ingredients for a candle. To get those ingredients, she
travels to the Mauthen farm and the Williams farm. The Williams are farmers who live in Newarre,
which, as this theory claims, is just some miles across the stream from the Mauthen arm.

_That_ post isn't written to highlight the locations however, it covers what she
is doing at the Farms and doesn't try to prove that they _are_ the Williams and
Mauthens Farms.

I would like to hear your thoughts, the more specific the observation the
better. e.g "but old cob prefers a wine from Vintas, that suggests they're in
Vint!". That's something we can all think about and I might be able to address.

I'm going to break theory into  several parts:

* Auri visiting the Mauthen Farm and then Newarre
* listen three times
* Maps
* Time
* Other considerations and counter arguments
* Getting to Newarre
* Covering the text

# Auri visit's Newarre and Mauthen Farm

First, I cover the means by which she gets there in [Ways to safe
places](/posts-output/2021-1-23-ways-to-safe-places). So either read that first
or accept that she can cover the necessary distance in a relatively short amount
of time. What were going to do _here_ is cover similarities between the places
Auri visit's in the SROST and the Williams Farm in Newarre (from TLT) followed
by the Mauthen Farm.

This requires you to read the chapter "A quite uncommon pleasant place" in
SROST. and pages 766 to 771 in TLT. Pulling direct references would become
tiresome quickly for you as it would be nearly everything between those pages
and you wouldn't have the narrative to help. That being said, I'll go ahead and
do that in a section called "Covering the text"

For now, I'm just going to bullet point them.

## Williams Farm 

<img src="/img/farmer.jpg" height="500px" width="350px">

Relationships between the Farm Auri's visit (SROST) and the Williams Farm
(TLT):

* The girl that sees Auri with her serious eyes is likely Nettie's older daughter.
* The same *black dog* bay's at Auri and Bast
* Nettie has a trio of Goat's, Auri meets one or a relative.
* The honey that Auri takes is from Nettie, who has bee hives and also uses it
  for candles.
* The farmhouse Auri visits has a bearskin upon a rack to cure and Rikes father
  Jessom hunts, traps and likely tans.
* Both the farmhouse Auri visits farmhouse and the Williams have a garden.
* Both have gardens
* Both locations have a barn and the _hard years_ between when Auri visits and 
when Bast does would explain why its in disarray, the stone bottom remains, but in Bast's timeframe
the wooden roof has rotted off.
* Auri's Farmhouse has a Churn which could be used to make butter, which the
  Williams have.
* Auri finds suet, and Nettie makes candles which are made suing suet.

In terms of a time frame, Auri visit's before Bast, which explains why the tall
barn had fallen into disrepair. The barn Auri sees is stone on the bottom and
wood on top, which is why later when Bast sees it, the roof had rotted away is
and now gaping open.

Note, I have left out some of the symbolic evidence, the Warrens theory, that
ties the location Auri visit's to the Williams Farm even further. We are also
ignoring the narrative that would explain how and why because it would distract
from the overwhelming physical evidence. There are around *10 plus* similarities
here. Ask your self how much discussion is had about other idea's which only a
fraction of the connections? Rothfuss hide a lot of details in SROST that are
easy to over look because of Auri's nature.

The Williams Farm is actually the second stop on Auri's trip. We started there
because there is more evidence. Her first stop, I'll now try to convince you is
the Mauthen farm. In order to get to get their Auri has to cross a stream:

> Later still, Auri crossed a creek she’d never seen before and was surprised to
> find a tiny farmhouse tucked among the trees.

Which would likely be the same stream Denna and Kvothe stop at in NOTW:72:549

> We wandered wordlessly away from our search, neither one of us wanting to

Had they gone farther, they would have gotten to Newarre, but they didn't
because of those damn... _pegs_. 

I want to underline that I suspected the Mauthen Farm was the GraveYard were
about to discuss before I saw this. I considered the graveyard could be the
Haert or The Cthaeh's tree. But it isn't either, it's the Mauthen Farm. Discussed
in part, in a chapter of the Name of the wind, called Waystone. But Pat's hint
dropping in the chapters doesn't stop there, recall that the chapter in SROS
that were discussing is called "A Quite Uncommon Pleasant Place". This refers to the second part of her Journey to Newarre. Which
she found 

> Surprised by pleased. It was a seemly place. 

Qui*te* is often confused with Qui*et*. Another gentle nod from our author referencing Kote's silence. 

But Let's continue on, and return to Mauthen Farm and compare it to the graveyard Auri visit's:

## Mauthen Farm / Barrow Hill 

<img src="/img/barrowhill.jpeg" height="300px" width="450px">


You should see Chapter seventy-two in NOTW and some of the following chapters
for reference.

Here are the ways in which the Mauthen Farm is like the graveyard Auri visit's in
chapter in SROST chapter "A Quite Uncommon Place":

* Auri visit's a graveyard, The Barrows/Mauthen Farm are a grave/bone yard as the
  pig farmer mentions the Mauthen's dug up bones.
* Auri finds pine cones in the area, The Mauthen Farm has pine trees which could
  drop them.
* The Mauthen Farm is said to have a "stone outcropping", which might be
  gravestones Auri sees.
* They both have mushrooms & acorns.
* The monument Auri sees could be the Barrow itself. Note, a monumnnt can refer
  to a statue or other structure placed by or over a grave in memory of the
  dead
* The Iron fence from the graveyard could be the Iron Wheel in Town near the
  farm

This is less direct evidence than we got for the Williams Farm. Let's consider
some speculative and metaphorical evidence before going on:

* The leaf Auri breaths on could be the one Kvothe swallows.
* The graveyard Ivy could be how The Denner Tree's near the farm make addicts
  teeth white.
* Verinan, who kvothe compares to a _Verinan_, a red flower, and could be the graveyard's
  roses.

Those are some strong connections and some weaker ones. As it stands however,
compared to other locations in the book, It's far more likely to be the Mauthen
farm.

# Listen three times.

In what I can assume is Pat being awful clever, were given a couple of hints via wordplay that likely have been
remarked upon but not with supporting evidence. 

Less easily spotted is the double meaning to _peg_. 

> A peg is a bolt or pin that holds something in place or marks a location. 

A head nod by Pat that this is an important location. Figuratively, _peg_ is "A support; a reason; a pretext." Here the
_pegs_ serve as the reason Kvothe and Denna give up there hunt.

More noticeable is the use of the word "nowhere" to
describe the location. However, it might have slipped your attention that it's mentioned exactly three times in our main series:

1. Were given this hint just a little while before the stream. NOTW:73:562:

> “But this is nowhere.” She looked around aimlessly. “This is the outside edge
> of nowhere....”


2. Then Denna, again a bit later on when they discover the Denner and the lookout. NOTW:77:590:

> “At least now we know why he was hiding in the middle of nowhere with a crossbow and a lookout and all that,” Denna said. “A minor mystery solved.”

3. Then Simmon when talking about Denna and Kvothe's recent trip around Trebon. NOTW:84:632:

> She makes up an excuse to wander around the middle of nowhere with you for a couple of days....”

Listen three times, Newarre is near Trebon. 

# Maps

It might be useful to have one or both maps of the Four Corners at hand. As
misleading as they are at times, its better then nothing. You should head down to Worldbuilders and buy everything they have. 
I'll use the old map and old ways are best.

<img src="/img/old-kkc-map.jpg" height="325px" width="450px">

# Time

Auri visits Newarre and the Mauthen Farm on _her_ 2nd day. This corresponds to
Hepten, in the same span as admissions for kvothe at the start of TWMF. 
Working backward Auri gives the candle to
Kvothe on Cendling/10. Which has a nice ring to it, a candle on C*a*ndlng.
Almost like its on purpose? The day before admissions, kvothe was stuck in his
rooms crying. This was a *g*reaving day. This would place the day Auri's day 3
where she wept with Chaen/7. That number seems to cause a lot of pain. She
starts gathering her candle materials, from the The Twelve (a pool), on Orden.
Which I always get confused with Ordal. 

Here is a table, that will likely come in handy in future posts. Note that
"-" just means I'm not commenting, not that nothing happened.

 <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center;">Num</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>

    <th>Cendling</th>
    <th>6</th>

    <th>admission</th>
  </tr>
</table> 

This would make it "hard" for _Auri_ to have breathed on the leaf that kvothe
caught in his mouth at the Mauthen Farm. The one that leads to the presumed
named _master ash_ for Denna's mysterious Patron. sense this implies Auri's trip
happened long after Kvothe's visit there. I'll note the leaf has little to do with
the rest of the theory and so if it helps you can ignore that part of the theory for now.

Secondly, Auri's perception of time and our understanding of it might be skewed. Making it hard
to be sure how much time has passed between Kvothes, Auri's and Bast's visit.


# Other considerations & Counter arguments

This section will cover hints we get from Kote's time line that suggest the
location of Newarre.

1. Rings and Wings  : covering Bast's rings
2. Colors and Coins : discussing the colors the soliders wear that visit Newarre
3. Roads and Codes  : suggesting that some interactions and phrases, like water before wine, are codes.
4. Counter arguments: where I addresses some sorted questions that suggest the location is in Vintas

## Rings, Wings and the beast within


Bast's room is likely full of little delights and mysteries I haven't picked apart. One thing we need to take note of here is
the rings that rest on his shelves. TWMF::10

>  There were shelves filled with pictures, trinkets, and oddments. Locks of hair wrapped in ribbon.
> Whistles carved from wood. Dried flowers. Rings of horn and leather and woven grass. A handdipped candle with leaves pressed into the wax.

Rings of horn, leather and woven grass. Those particular _kinds_
of rings however are conspicuously mentioned by another enigma half a world
away. TMWF::446

> “That’s true for the most part,” Bredon said. “But the giving of rings goes back quite a ways. The
> common folk were doing it long before it became a game for the gentry. And while Stapes may
> breathe the rarified air with the rest of us, his family is undeniably common.”
> Bredon set the white ring back onto the board and folded his hands over it. “Those rings were made
> of things ordinary folk might find easily at hand. A young lover might give a ring of new green grass
> to someone he was courting. A ring of leather promises service. And so on.”
> “And a ring of horn?”
> “A ring of horn shows enmity,” Bredon said. “Powerful and lasting enmity.”

Bredon conspicuously describes the same kinds rings Bast has in his possession:

* green grass : romantic interest
* leather     : service
* horn        : powerful and lasting enmity

It's worth considering here, in a post about the location of Newarre, because
because were shown that ring giving is a Vintish tradition. Overall this implies
Bast has a relationship with Vintas, the tradition of rings, it's history or
Bredon himself. Bredon says the custom of ring giving goes way back? How far
back? I think Skarpi tells us of one of the first examples of ring giving, if
not _the first_. NOTW::198

> They came to Aleph, and he touched them. He touched their hands and eyes and
> hearts. The last time he touched them there was pain, and wings tore from
> their backs that they might go where they wished. Wings of fire and shadow.
> Wings of iron and glass. Wings of stone and blood.

Time tends to warp stories, like a game of whispers played through the ages, but
that isn't the case here as our story teller was likely around to see it
himself, being on a first name with Tehlu and all. However, he gives us the wiggle room
we need by implying he might have fudged some details. NOWT:192

> “More or less. You have to be a bit of a liar to tell a story the right way. Too much truth confuses the facts. Too much honesty makes you sound insincere.”

So, considering we have meet anyone with _wings_ of power, but plenty of people
with _rings_ of power. It's reasonable to assume ring goes way back, older then tree or stone. 
Enough that we might see some form of it everywhere. Indeed we see an example first hand at the University. TWMF::317

> “Fela,” he said seriously. “I hereby promote you to the rank of Re’lar.” He held up the ring. “Your
> hand.”
> Almost shyly, Fela held out her hand. But Elodin shook his head. “Left hand,” he said firmly. “The
> right means something else entirely. None of you are anywhere near ready for that.”
> Fela held out her other hand, and Elodin slid the ring of stone easily onto her finger.


<img src="/img/fela.jpg" height="400px" width="250px">


I also suspect the universities admissions process, of drawing random tiles from
a bag, might share a historical lineage with the giving of rings and possible
Tak. NOTW::413

> I drew a tile out of the
> *black velvet bag*. It read “Hepten: Noon.” Five days from now, plenty of time
> to prepare.

Were told at least one of the types tiles is _ivory_. NOTW::74

> I drew the ivory admissions tile out of my purse

Fela's tile was ivory too, and as their marked, I assume they are all Ivory.

Ivory is from tusks and teeth of animals, horn refers specifically to
projections off the animal. There likely close enough to be interchangeable. If
the admissions process traces its roots back to the same origins as ring giving,
the implications are unsettling to say the least. 

Coming full circle, we travel back across the world where Bredon teaches
Kvothe a game nearly as subtle as naming called Tak. Where tiles are also drawn from
_black velvet bag_ as well, how delightful unnerving is that? TWMF::390

> I play a longer, more subtle game.” He began to work the drawstring loose on
> the *black velvet bag**.

Tak is a beautiful game, for some it's about mastery and wealth for others about
courtly elegance. The materials, rules and names changing from place to place.
True artist make a game of the game itself, using items of power, prestige
layered with hidden meaning to up the anti. Indeed some games were played for
the position of the board and materials itself. I would dearly love to see our
Tak teacher, use his walking stick's wolf's head (as a capstone) to _beat_
Kvothe in a game, it might improve his game a good deal to be humbled further.

TWMF:

> “Of course,” I said graciously. “Please have a seat.” I gestured toward the new table by the window.
> “Such aplomb,” he chuckled, leaning his walking stick against the window sill. The sunlight caught
> on the polished silver handle wrought in the shape of a snarling wolf ’s head.
> Bredon was older.

<img src="/img/capstone.jpg" height="215px" width="400px">

I'm sure he wouldn't _burn_ him to badly. Burn of course not referring to a
physical mistreatment but a Tak term used to describe winning the game. HOT:

> The gathered crowd were rapt withal To see the stranger burn.

The term used in a famous game played in *Abbot's Ford*. However, its bets to be to harsh
as you always want your dancing partner to come back.

It's possible if you play enough games you might have get a chance many would dread
and some envy, of playing Breon Mercer, who was said to be a "beast in the
skin of man". History Of Tak (HOT):

> It is said that Jezzered played with an emerald capstone carved in the shape
> of flower, until he lost it to Breon Mercer, to whom he later referred as "a
> beast in the skin of a man."

Yes, even the Fae and possible skin dancers of old enjoyed a good game once and a while.
Bred... oh, I'm sorry the Breon, certainly traveled the world and became famous for it. HOT:

> Breon Mercer, a charming rogue who traveled the world in high style, financed mainly by his winnings at Tak

Breon traveled the world and so did Tak, it's name and rules have changed
through time and spread through out the world to fit the people and customs of
the four corners. What was it called originally? I suspect that would be telling
indeed. Before this turns into a lesson on Tak, which I'm not ready to gave,
let's refocus.

Ring giving and Tak are ancient subtle games that rely on knowing
the board, your opponents and mostly importantly yourself. Kvothe hasn't taken
us to much of the world, but I suspect will see them played everywhere. 

In short, trying to place Newarre based on Bast's rings is problematic as he isn't a stone and might
have moved around and found them else where. It's possible his rings are more 
of a commentary on his relationship with another man, who plays like a beast when pushed. HOT:

> It is with deference and respect that I offer my own suggestion, that this

> subtlest of courtly games, but when money was on the line, he was known to
> eschew the niceties of play, and destroy his opponents with astonishing
> tactical brutality.

Finally, they could be Kvothe's rings, after all Kvothe gave Bast his folly. 

## Colors, Coins and what comes in time

The interludes from Kvothe's story give us some hints about the current state of
the world that Kote is living in. One of the strongest hints in terms of Newarre's
location comes from the colors the soldiers that give Kote a beating near the
end of TWMF:136:897

> The door of the Waystone opened and a sudden gust of wind made the lamplight
> flicker. Two soldiers came in, hunched against the weather, their swords
> sticking out like tails behind them. Dark spatters of rain spotted the fabric
> of their blue and white tabards.

They wear blue and white, which strongly indicates they were or are in the Maer's
service. TWMF:54:374

> They wore the Maer’s colors but beneath their sapphire and ivory

I think it's unlikely Rothfuss would trick us so cheaply by having someone take
his colors; it would also be very awkward politically. This doesn't necessarily
mean Newarre is near Severen. This indicates Newarre is accessible to
soldiers or deserters of the Maer's army.

When we leave Kote at the end of TMWF, we know there is a war going on. One that
Kote doesn't approve of, which is evident when he tries to talk the smith's
apprentice out of joining it. TMWF:2:371

> “I know how this war started. I know the truth of it. Once you hear that, you
> won’t be nearly so eager to run off and die fighting in the middle of it.”

The war was gong on in Kvothe's time-frame as well, only it hadn't come to armies
marching. A slow secret war where members of the Peerage seemed to be dropping
off the board. Lets recap the Peerage here, though this topic likely needs its
own space. Sim gives us a start. NOTW:43:309

> “Actually he’s sixteenth in the peerage,” Sim said matter-of-factly “You’ve
> got the royal family, the prince regents, Maer Alveron, Duchess Samista,
> Aculeus and Meluan Lackless....” He trailed off under Manet’s glare.

1. Royal Family
2. The Prince Reagents
3. Maer Alveron
4. Duchess Samista
5. Aculeus and Meluan Lackless

with Barron Jackass a bit further down

We know the Maer is taking Meluan to wife, which greatly strengths his
position. We also know that some people a bit further down this list between
Baron Jakis and the thrown have meet with some tragic events we can assume are
likely in part due to the Baron's power grab. The easiest to spot is the tragic
loss of the Surthen family, who were lost at Sea. NOT::309

> “His father ’s one of the most powerful men in Vintas,” Manet added, then
> turned to Simmon. “What is he, sixteenth in line to the throne?” “Thirteenth,”
> Simmon said sullenly. “The entire Surthen family was lost at sea two months

> steps from being king.”

An accident the Baron could likely arrange given turning your navy into pirates
is just a matter of a wardrobe change and he controls the area around which they
disappeared. TWMF:1:944

> “In this and many other things, I aim to disappoint,” I said. “I was sure he’d
> done it,” Devi continued. “His father ’s barony is called the Pirate Isles. I
> was sure

The reason for highlighting this is because, as suggested earlier, there is a
war brewing in the background and a war _outright_ in Kote's timeframe.
Power and likely land is changing hands. The Maer's reach might be far greater
then our maps imply.

We have further implicit evidence that Newarre is far from the Maer's seat of
power in Severen. For one, it wouldn't be _terrible clever_ for Kvothe to hide
near the people who are hunting him. Keep in mind we haven't established the
Maer put the bounty on Kvothe's head. But we have some hints as to who did. NOTW:2:521

> The innkeeper nodded. “Right. So if you were Kvothe, and terrible clever, as

Royals are part of the official currency in Vintas.

<img src="/img/Royals.jpg" height="350px" width="350px">

A Gold Royal is the coin that the smiths apprentice is tempted by. TWMF::483

> These days they hand you over a royal when you sign up. A whole gold royal.”

It's at the coin we see the bandits stealing from the Maer. TWMF:1:5:

> At a rough count, there were over two hundred royals. While I’d never actually
> held one, I knew a single gold royal was worth eighty bits, almost as much as
> the Maer had given me to finance this entire trip

As well as the coin, carried by the solider who beat up Kote. TWMF::898

Both the Maer and the King of Vintas use the Royal. But there is another hint from Kvothe
in the reward offered to capture him. TWMF::521

> And suddenly your head was worth a thousand royals and a duchy to whoever cut
> it off, what would you do?”

So who could offer a duchy? What culture even used duchies in the first place? We know that Sim's father is a duke and has
a duchy. NOTW:290

> “Sim’s father holds a duchy in Atur. Good land, but—”

Duke's have duches. Gibea was a Duke and Sim grew up not far from his lands. So its safe to say Atur.

This is all strong evidence that the current (_kotes_ timeline) King of Vint is the one who put a
bounty on Kvothes head. How would the King of Vint be offering a Duchy from Atur? Lets stow this idea for a
moment and touch on one more piece of evidence were given early in the books,
when Kote suggests the he thinks the mountains have slowed down the Scrael. NOTW::7

> The innkeeper’s eyes were distant. “Scrael,” he said distractedly. “I’d
> thought the mountains—”

Again, this is hardly definitive as there are mountains _everywhere_. But it's
worth keeping in mind. More helpful is that Kote suggests the Scrael had to
travel _far west_. NOTW::228

> The innkeeper frowned. “They can’t have made it this far west yet,” he said
> softly.

Severen and Vintas isn't _far west_ compared to most of the rest of the four
corners. If the Scrael are coming from the Eld, its very possible Kote is
talking about The Six Sisters mountain range.

Time to take off your tin foil hats and put on your thinking caps.

If you were Kvothe, and terrible clever, would you settle in Modeg or Ceald,
where you would stick out like a sore thumb? Would you settle in Vintas or Atur,
either or both of which were controlled by the ruler who has put a bounty on
your head? Where you name and description are likely being circulated?

The two soldier's are likely deserters. Or can you come up with a reason why
there wandering around as only pair and beating up inn keepers. They don't seem
overly worried about keeping there colors on, which would be extra foolish if
they were in the strong hold of Vintish power. No, there not worried because
there in the middle of nowhere.

If it's the current king of Vintas, that put the bounty out, why are the
soldiers wearing the Maers colors? The obvious answer is that the King has
brought the Maer into his service as is likely his right. But the soldiers claim
to have _just taken_ the Kings coin and they show the it off to prove it. This
implies they just joined the kings ranks and they were clothed in the Maer's
colors. So maybe the Maer is the new King of Vintas, but then how is the Maer offering an Aturn
Dutchy? The answer is simple, there is a war, the Maer now controls Vintas, part of Atur
and his reach extends into the Commonwealth. 

The world is on fire, ancient wars are burning bright and somewhere near Trebon
an inn keeper stares into the night sky and wanders what the winds will bring him
next.

## Roads and Codes

<img src="/img/kote-nameless.jpg" height="400px" width="280px">


Early on in their meeting, Kvothe asks Chronicler about the Road to Tinuë. NOTW:

> “Before we discuss the possibility that you’ve addled your wits with that crack to the head, tell me, how is the road to Tinuë?”

This is important to touch on, because if we assume he is talking about "The
free City of Tinue" in Vintas, this again would imply Newarre is in
Vintas. Chronicler is confused at first, but he recovers, remembering something,
he replies more or less that's not going well.

>“What?” Chronicler asked, irritated. “I wasn’t heading to Tinuë. I was ... oh.

Now, I have theories about that word that would leave you frothing at the mouth
and tearing our your hair, but I'll contain myself and suggest that the question
has little to do with the physical location of "Free city of Tinuë" as displayed on the map.

Wil remarks that the language of the commonwealth is rich with idioms, and that
"How is the road to Tinuë" is one of the worst offenders. Idioms hide secrets in plan sight, 
and this one is no different. Tinue comes up in the background _alot_:

Jax passed through Tinuë, the Lackless once controlled it, Sceop was on his way
to it and Denna says she has visited it. Tinkers suggest you try their limes. It
once was a shining beacon of _art_ during the reign of _Verian_. Once there was
a vicious game of *Tak*et played there between a brewer and a
tanner played there. The book on Tak is called "The Road to Tinuë: A history of Tak". 

A drunken Tinker might turn our map upside a couple times, let his eyes glaze
over, and start wonder if the great stone road isn't a _bridge_ of another sort.
Lastly, *Tinusa* was one of the eight remaining cities in Skarpi's story. Was
this the city that remembered the Lethani?

In short, Tinuë is a mystery and it's enough for our purposes here to say asking
about it might mean more then referring to the city on our map. I suspect it's a
code phrase to see if you understand the hidden turnings of the world. Maybe the
Chronicler got it right. But it doubt it, for my part, I think Rike in his heart
knows the way things are going. TLT:

A long damn way indeed.

## What no defense?

I purpose that Newarre is in the Commonwealth and it's near Trebon. This idea
likely isn't new, but it has some issues that need to be resolves. So let us
address some counter-arguments and preexisting works and see if anything blows a
hole in this idea. Parts of my answers will be covered else where in this post
but I want to respond to these concerns one at time so we don't overlook
anything.

One of the more cited pieces on Newarre is this post in 2012 on
[tor](https://www.tor.com/2012/05/10/rothfuss-reread-speculative-summary-10-the-road-to-newarre/).
Where the author says it's conclusive and no one has challenged it. I'll be
going through this piece by piece and adding commentary. the pattern will be:

My commentary.

-------------
..

> Newarre is most likely in western Vintas, probably on the southern border of
> the Eld.

The first piece of evidence we have is Kvothe's admission that the Scrael
come from the east and his surprise that they’ve “made it this far west yet.”
He “thought the mountains” presumably would have stopped them or slowed
them down.

> Looking at the map, we see that the only significant mountain ranges that

 1. Everything is west of the Stormwal Mountains. However, The mountains could be
 the Six Sisters if the Scrael are coming from the Eld. Which is how Kvothe gets
 into the Fae. Also Kvothe says "this far west". If were going off 4 corners
 map, the Vintas anything but far _west_. It's actually far _east_.

Someone suggests it's far western, which is good for my theory. I can't find the comment there referencing though.

> Ceald, Modeg and Vintas.

Kvothe doesn't say the mountain range was sizable.

agreed

The eld is likely famous enough to be mentioned anywhere.

A point in favor of Trebon!

in an area controlled by Vintas, likely so. near atur, tinue and eld? i don't
see why that would have to be.

The strongest evidence against it is concerning the currency. Which As i stated
at the start of this theory could be explained by the King conquering lands
around Trebon.

A friend made a good suggestion that we get a mapping from fears to areas from
Ben

They are afraid of Demons in Newarre. Which would put them close to Atur. While not
_in_ Atur, Trebon and likely Newarre is close enough to it to pick up some echos
of it. Especially since Atur controlled those lands in the past.

Another issue is that one of the soldiers colors are of the Maer's house.

Ok. They don't mention the colors so lets go find them.

----
It's _not_ at the start of the series when Chronicler is peacefully robbed.

Likely there referring to this near the end of NOTW:

blue and white

> They wore the Maer ’s colors but beneath their sapphire and ivory 

fair enough, they are wearing the Maer's colors. This likely means the are the
Maer's men. This could mean Newarre is likely near or in land the Maer controls.
Given there is something of a succession war going on in the background of the
story.

# Getting to Newarre.


<img src="/img/kvothehorse.jpeg" height="300px" width="450px">

So then, where is Newarre? If we're right, this is the easy part. First, we get to
Trebon, then Mauthen farm and follow it towards the stream and assume it's some
distance beyond that. Feel free to skip to the map a the bottom as this is
mostly book-keeping. All of this is from NOTW chapters 70 onward.

Kvothe starts from dockside inn. Somewhere near the Omethi river and the
University.

> They looked up, obviously irritated by the interruption. Gentlemen had been a

> “Did you come by way of Marrow?” I asked, picking a northern town at random.

> “No,” the fat one said. “We’re down from Trebon.”


So Trebon, isn't on any official map, so we can't just hope there. Were told you
can reach trebon by the Omethi river upstream of the university by a couple
days:

> “How far is it to Trebon?” I asked. “Upriver? A couple days.”

The road must wind a bit more than the river, as it's longer by road:

> “I asked how far,” she snapped at him. “Is it longer than the riverway?”

> “Damn sight longer. About twenty-five leagues by road. A hard road too,
> uphill.”

A league: 2-3.5 miles, that information doesn't seem to help much because no map
has a scale to speak of. Nor likely could we trust one.

Kvothe tells the tinker, who he wouldn't lie to, that he did travel about 70
miles. We assume this leads him close to the Omethi, but which side. It's not
clear. But i'm guessing east side, given there is more land there. On the way
back he asks people if there are headed up Imre way, which could imply on Imre
side.

From tinker meeting, Trebon is half mile to north and evesdown docks to the
east.

The only way the docks could be to the east is if kvothe was on the west side of
the Omethi OR if he rounded the bend. If he is on the east side of the Omethi
then all his travels happend in the little tringle between the omethi and the
great stone road. Given he chooses to not use the Great stone road, and my guess
that the map is more accurate this close to the university. Im guessing he didn't
make it to the bend and is on the west side.

Trebon is between a mining and a farming town. The farming town could be
Newarre, but that doesn't help us place it as far as I can tell.

Mauthen farm is about a mile out, I'm guessing North.

They go to "borroill"

the start behind a bluff and then travel into the woods. I don't see any hint at
which direction so this doesn't help

Finally, the end up heading back and towards the bluffs in the north. Im
guessing this means there closer to the split between Ceald that has the
mountain range. But again speculation. So will end up drawing a wide circle

On the map the Green is where It would likely have to be If the theory is
correct. Red is where a more specific guess based on the text and what I think
is more likely.

<img src="/img/map-with-newarre.jpg" height="350px" width="350px">

There might be some information in the History of Tak, which clarifies the location of Newaree.  
Specifically, there is mention of Abbot's Ford, where a historic game of tak is played:

> In Abbot's Ford we lay our scene...

This is a place mentioned a couple times in the frame in relation to Chronicler's journey to Newarre:

>“I am behind schedule,” Chronicler admitted. “My horse was stolen near **Abbott’s
>Ford**.” He glanced out the window at the darkening sky. “But I’m willing to lose
>some sleep. I’ll be off in the morning and out of your hair.”

The term Tak is relatively modern and in wide use around the four corners.
Though variants still exist. It might be possible to narrow down where Abbott's
ford down even further by examining the story and comparing the game to how tak
is played in various places. My gut tells me that Abbott's _ford_ might be related to **Ford**ell,
which is a land sound of the university and by my guess, Newarre.



# Covering the text

* SROST chapter "A quite uncommon pleasant place", is where Auri visits these locations.
* The Williams farm is covered in "The Lighting Tree". 

Auri visits a graveyard, which I suggest is really the Mauthen farm. As you
gathered reading SROST, Auri views things quite differently then most people.
She assigns meaning to things based on attributes she finds interesting, not
just there physical appearance. e.g _Rude pipes_. This skews her perception and
so we have to sometimes compare based on symbolism and how things feel. If you
read my post on [Alchemy](/posts-output/2021-1-23-alchemy) and [Fae
magic](/posts-output/2021-1-22-bitter-brew), you might be able to find an in universe
reason why she would have this outlook.

## Mauthen farm ~ Graveyard Auri visits

### Graveyard with Auri

Notable, the evidence for the Muathen farm is thinner, I suspect I might be missing
some meaning to _ivy_ and the _stone with letters worn away_. I have

One idea is that this could be the cite of Myr Tariniel. Which might also be the
tower mentioned in old holly that is covered in _vines_. This idea won't feel
compelling to you now, but we might be able to justify it later, so it's worth
keeping in your back pocket. 


### Mauthen Farm with Kvothe and Denna

Note because Kvothe never goes into the house, due largely to Denna, we don't see what i'm guessing is Auri's _Monument_.

Here are the references in the book beyond that:

NOTW:72:549

> After five minutes I began to sense the futility of it. There was just too much forest. I could tell that Denna quickly came to the same conclusion. The storybook clues we hoped to find once again failed to show themselves. There were no torn scraps of cloth clinging to branches, no deep bootprints or abandoned campsites. We did find *mushrooms*, *acorns*, mosquitoes, and raccoon scat cleverly concealed by *pine needles*.

NOTW:73:559

> “Man wants his daughter tae have a fine house wit a view, that’s all tae the good,” Schiem conceded. “But when ye’re diggen the foundation an’ yeh find *bones* an’ such, an’ yeh don’t stop ... that’s a whole new type of stupid.”

> Schiem nodded, leaning forward. “An that weren’t the worst o’ it. He keeps diggen, an’ he hits *stones*. Then does he stop?” He sniffed. “He starts pullen ’em up, looken for more so he can use them for the house!”

> I looked out over the rolling hills, gold with autumn leaves and wheat fields, green with pasture and stands of pine and fir. Scattered throughout were the dark scars of bluffs and *stone outcroppings*. “There’s a lot of ground to cover....” I said.

## Williams Farm ~ farm Auri visits

### Farm Auri Visits

You should make special note of the ways both Bast and Auri _feel_ about things. e.g _baying and bay_

I'll leave Auri's as one whole piece and i'll chop up what Bast sees
and highlight similarities.

### The Williams Farm

Bast visit is sometime after Auri's likely 5 plus years.

Both Auri and Bast see a Barn. Given several _hard_ years have come to the Williams, 
its not surprising the barn has fallen in to disrepair:

> The tall **barn** had fallen into disrepair and half the
> roof gaped open to the sky. Walking up the long path through the

> than the **barn**. It was small but tidy. The shingles needed some repair, but other
> than that, it looked well loved and tended-to. 


Auri see a dog "all gristle and bay". A dog at the Williams farm bays at Bast.
Auri sees goats,garden and honey all which the williams have as well: 

> There was a pen with a trio of **goats** on one side of the house, and a
> large welltended **garden** on the other. It was fenced thickly with lashed-together

Likely, its Nettie's daughter with the _serious dark eyes_ that spots Auri, only several years younger:

> A little girl peeked
> out from around the woman’s faded blue skirt, nothing more than a pair of
> ** serious dark eyes**.

Auri sees the bearskin, with wouldn't be out of place given Jessom hunts:

> “He (Jessom) **traps and hunts** for the most part these

Nettie has bee's and so her farm would have honey which Auir takes:

>  She (Nettie) looked a little puzzled at that until Bast nodded toward the
> **wooden hives**

Nettie makes candles which explains the *suet* Auri sees and takes:

# End

Thanks for reading! 

Here is are some bonus sections that are a bit rougher and more abstract. Those
"lighting Tree and silence" are "not nowhere" and "nowhere at all", where we go
down the rabbit whole. That's followed by some necessary book keeping: credits,
citations and rights.

## Lighting Tree

Later, Auri mentions to Kvothe that she saw a tree that looks like lighting in TWMF::195

> “I was looking at the lightning,” she said, sniffling. Then, “I saw one that looked like a tree.”
> “What was in the lightning?” I asked softly.
> “Galvanic ionization,” she said. Then, after a pause, she added, “And river-ice. And the sway a cattail makes.”

I'll leave you to ponder the implications. We will return to this later in the Warrens series.

## not nowhere

Pat is to clever by half. His best tricks are to set up at least three meanings to a phrase, comment or word. Newarre is no different. The careful observer will note it's similarity to "nowhere". But a madman will note
it's similarity to _new warren_. 

I'm not going to flush the meaning of that here, but I will suggest you ponder the word _warren_. It's use
in the poem at the start of the post that should have lead you here: [Warren Windershins Ways and Woes](2021-1-22-bone-and-crystal). I'll even link the passage in the book that mentions warrens. TMWF:73:494:

> But Denna’s version was different. In her song, Lanre was painted in tragic tones, a hero wrongly
> used. Selitos’ words were cruel and biting, Myr Tariniel a *warren* that was better for the purifying
> fire. Lanre was no traitor, but a fallen hero.

## nowhere at all

I want to quickly Highlight two oddities that are intentional on the authors part but I can't assign meaning to:

1. Simmon comes for a visit.
2. Elodin is in town.

Two visitors that fit the descriptions of Simmon and Wil visit the Inn.

>  Two young men, one sandy-haired, one dark, well dressed and well-spoken.

But that's not where it's stops, the sandy haired one recognizes kvothe when he heard him sing

> “Kvothe the Bloodless.” The man pressed ahead with the dogged persistence of
> the inebriated. “You looked familiar, but I couldn’t finger it.” He smiled
> proudly and tapped a finger to his nose. “Then I heard you sing, and I knew it
> was you. I heard you in Imre once. Cried my eyes out afterward. I never heard
> anything like that before or since. Broke my heart.”

Simmon did cry his eyes out. _But wait there is more_

> tapped a finger to his nose

Simmon to likes to tap his noes:

> Simmon pressed on. “Yes. Some say that it’s the ghost of a student who got
> lost in the building and starved to death.” He tapped the side of his nose

He even says "like an old gaffer" which cob is and he does in this rather ominous scene:

But maybe noes tapping is a regional gesture?

2. Elodin is in town

Kvothe doesn't get along with the local priest:

Whose last name is a just a quick 2 letter swap to "elodin". 

Over all conclusions and tin foil guesses? Well, maybe Kvothe is trapped within
his sleeping mind, maybe the whole world is. Maybe something has robbed Kvothe of
his name and history, so that even his close friends only remember the story, and not the man 
they grew up with.



## A full accounting of nowhere

The word nowhere appears 51 times across Srost, history of tak, notw, twmf. 

It's mentioned 3-4 times directly relating to the location I suggest is Newaree. But refering to nowhere like its a locaiton happens here:

> “At least now we know why he was hiding in the middle of nowhere with a crossbow and a lookout and all that,” Denna said. “A minor mystery solved.”
> Sim looked back and forth between us, plainly surprised he had to explain himself. “It’s obvious she has a thing for you,” he said, and began counting on his fingers. “She finds you at Anker’s. She comes to get you that night at Eolian when we’re drinking. She makes up an excuse to wander around the middle of nowhere with you for a couple of days....”
> “But this is nowhere.” She looked around aimlessly. “This is the outside edge of nowhere....”
> little town out in the middle of nowhere. Then I’d open an inn and do my best to disappear.” He

### Alleg

Ah, you say but what about Alleg? The Trouper turned bandit and robber that kvothe left to die in the middle of nowhere.

> With proper care it might be a full span of days before he died. Even
> alone in the middle of nowhere he could live for days with such a wound.

Well fine. I'll claim Bast killed him in Newaree. Yep that's right, I have the audacity to claim
the taller of the two soliders that robbed Kote was Alleg. Crazy, I know. Lets be concise about this story.
The villagers from Levinshir road out and found Alleg, wanting answers themselves the brought him back and
a Gran being worth twice the students in the Medica was congealed into pressured into healing him. Either by the townsfolk
or the Azzie (law). Fast forward, he somehow takes the kings coin, either because the king is emptying the prisons or what ever you like. He travels with the army that runs off.

This is pure fan-fiction of course, but there is the rub. They look the same. 
The solider has a black beard and kvothe comments on him rubbing its **edge**

> “One is a bad number for an Edema on the road,” Alleg said persuasively, running a finger along
> the **edge** of his dark beard.

Meanwhile our soldier has:

> He was bald on top, with a thick black beard that was flat as a **spade**

Alleg was branded on his chest and palm. 

> Pulling the broken circle from the fire again, I moved to
> Alleg and pressed it onto his palm.

The solider has a fist of knuckles and scar. 

> He was taller than Kvothe, and his fists were broad knots of **scar** and knuckle.

Now of course, I would assume that refers to the outside. But the fist includes your entire hand. When
the 10the anniversary TWMF comes out, i'm going to check if he still gets branded on the palm or is it changes to the back of his hand. 

What's more, nothing about there descriptions contradicts. The solider was bald, Kote never mentions Allegs hair. 
Imagine the shock when Kote looks at the soliders hands and see a broken circle:

> His eyes half-focused and dull
> with confusion, he looked down at his wrist and made the motion again, but his hands merely
> scrabbled uselessly at the soldier ’s scarred fist.
> The bearded soldier eyed the stupefied innkeeper with amused curiosity, then reached out and
> slapped him hard on the side of the head. “You’re almost a bit of a scrapper, boy,” he said. “You

What a sick joke. Especially if Kote himself has been branded and cut away in another way. It's enough to make you laugh
up shattered glass.

> Curled on the floor, Kvothe began to make a low, rhythmic sound. It was a dry, quiet noise that
> scratched around the edges of the room. Kvothe paused as he drew a painful breath.
> The bearded soldier frowned and kicked him again. “I asked you a question, cully . . .”
> The innkeeper made the same noise again, louder than before. Only then did it become obvious that
> he was laughing. Each low, broken chuckle sounded like he was coughing up a piece of shattered
