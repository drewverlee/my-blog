The theory is that Newarre is near Trebon and the Mauthen farm. The idea relies
on several elements that will discuss individually, either here, or in other
posts which I'll link to. The bulk of this Theory is a piece of another titled
[Warren Widdershins Ways and Woes](/posts-output/2021-1-15-bone-and-crystal)
in which Auri gets the ingredients for a candle. To get those ingredients, she
travels to the Mauthen Farm and the Williams Farm. The Williams are farmers live in Newarre,
which is just some miles across the stream from the Mauthen Farm. Or so this
theory goes.

 That post isn't written to highlight the locations however, it 
covers this material, but it doesn't hammer it down like we're going to do here.
So I'll be recovering the relevant parts here. In the end, I would like to hear
your thoughts, the more specific the observation the better. e.g "but old cob
Prefers a wine from Vintas, that suggests they're in Vint!". That's something we
can all think about and I might be able to address

So I'm going to break this into three parts:

1. Auri's visiting the Mauthen Farm and then Newarre
2. other considerations and counter arguments
3. Getting to Newarre

# Auri visit's Newarre and Mauthen Farm

First, I cover how she gets there in [Ways to safe
places](/posts-output/2021-1-23-ways-to-safe-places).
So either read that first, or accept that she can move around fast. What were
going to do here is cover similarities between the places Auri visit's in the
SROST and the Williams Farm in Newarre followed by the Mauthen Farm.

This requires you to read the chapter "A quite uncommon pleasant place" in
SROST. and pages 766 to 771 in TLT. pulling direct references would become
tiresome quickly for you as it would be nearly everything between those pages
and you wouldn't have the narrative to help. So I'm just going to bullet point
them.

## Williams Farm 

<img src="/img/farmer.jpg" height="500px" width="350px">

Relationships between the Farm Auri's visit's (SROST) and the Williams Farm
(TLT):

* The girl that see's Auri with her serious eye's is Nettie's daughter Tess.
* The same dog bay's at Auri and Bast
* Nettie has a trio of Goat's, Auri meets one or a relative.
* The honey that Auri takes is from Nettie, who has bee hives and also uses it
  for candles.
* The farmhouse Auri visit's has a bearskin upon a rack to cure and Rikes father
  Jessom hunts and traps.
* Both Auri's farmhouse and the Williams have a garden.
* Both locations have a barn.

In terms of a time frame, Auri visit's before Bast, which explains why the tall
barn had fallen into disrepair. The barn Auri sees is stone on the bottom and
wood on top, which why later when Bast sees it, the roof had rotted away is
and now gaping open.

Note, I have left out some of the symbolic evidence, the Warrens theory, that ties
the location Auri visit's to the Williams Farm even further. We are also ignoring
the narrative that would explain how and why because it would distract
from the overwhelming physical evidence. There are around *10* similarities here.

The Williams Farm is actually the second stop on Auri's trip. We started there
because there is more evidence. Here first stop, I'll now try to convince you is
the Mauthen farm. In order to get to get their Auri has to cross a stream:

> Later still, Auri crossed a creek she’d never seen before and was surprised to
> find a tiny farmhouse tucked among the trees.

Which would likely be the same stream Denna and Kvothe stop at in NOTW:72:549

> stream about twenty feet across.

<img src="/img/streamkvothedenna.jpeg" height="550px" width="375px">

Had they gone farther, they would have gotten to Newarre, but they didn't
because of those damn... _pegs_. 

I want to underline that I suspected the Mauthen Farm was the GraveYard were
about to discuss before I saw this. I considered the graveyard could be the
Haert or The Cthaeh's tree. But it isn't either, it's the Mauthen Farm. Discussed
in part, in a chapter of the Name of the wind, called WayStone. But Pat's hint
dropping in the chapters doesn't stop there, recall that the chapter in SROS
that were discussing is called

A Quite Uncommon Pleasant Place. This refers to the second part of her Journey to Newarre. Which
she found 

> Surprised by pleased. It was a seemly place. 

Qui*te* is often confused with Qui*et*. Another gentle nod from our author. 

But Let's continue on, and return to Mauthen Farm and compare it to the graveyard Auri visit's:

## Mauthen Farm / Barrow Hill 

<img src="/img/barrowhill.jpeg" height="300px" width="450px">


You should see Chapter seventy-two in NOTW and some of the following chapters
for reference.

Here are the ways in which the Mauthen Farm is like the graveyard Auri visit's in
chapter in SROST chapter "A Quite Uncommon Place":

* Auri visit's a graveyard, The Barrows/Mauthen Farm are a grave/bone yard as the
  pig farmer mentions the Mathen's dug up bones.
* Auri finds pine cones in the area, The Mauthen Farm has pine trees which could
  leave them.
* The Mauthen Farm is said to have a "stone outcropping", which might be
  gravestones Auri sees.
* They both have mushrooms.
* The monument Auri sees could be the Borrow it'self. Note, a monumnnt can refer
  to _a statue or other structure placed by or over a grave in memory o the
  dead_
* The Iron fence from the graveyard could be the Iron Wheel in Town near the
  farm
* 

This is less direct evidence than we got for the Williams Farm. Let's consider
some speculative and metaphorical evidence before going on:

* The leaf Auri breaths on could be the one Kvothe swallows.
* The graveyard Ivy could be how The Denner Tree's near the farm make addicts
  teeth white.
* Verinan, who kvothe compares to a _Verinan_ red flower, could be the graveyard
  rose.

Those are some strong connections and some weaker ones. As it stands however,
compares to other locations in the book, It's far more likely to be the Mauthen
farm.

## Listen three times.

In what I can assume is Pat being awful clever, were given a couple of hints via wordplay that likely have been
remarked upon but not with supporting evidence. 

Less easily spotted is the double meaning to _peg_. 

> A peg is a bolt or pin that holds something in place or marks a location. 

A head nod by Pat that this is an important location. More noticeable is the use of the word "nowhere" to
describe the location. However, it might have slipped your attention that it's mentioned exactly three times

1. Were given this hint just a little while before the stream. NOTW:73:562:

> “But this is nowhere.” She looked around aimlessly. “This is the outside edge
> of nowhere....”


2. Then Denna, again a bit later on when they discover the Denner and the lookout. NOTW:77:590:

> “At least now we know why he was hiding in the middle of nowhere with a crossbow and a lookout and all that,” Denna said. “A minor mystery solved.”

3. Then Simmon when talking about Denna and Kvothe's recent trip around Trebon. NOTW:84:632:

> She makes up an excuse to wander around the middle of nowhere with you for a couple of days....”

Listen three times, Newarre is near Trebon. 


## Other considerations & Counter arguments

So then, I purpose that Newarre is in the Commonwealth and it's near Trebon. Will
be more specific later, but first lets address some counter arguments and
preexisting works and see if anything blows a hole in this idea.

One of the more cited pieces on Newarre is this post in 2012 on [tor](https://www.tor.com/2012/05/10/rothfuss-reread-speculative-summary-10-the-road-to-newarre/). Where the author says it's conclusive and no one has challenged it. 

I'll be going through this piece by piece and adding commentary. the pattern will be:

> quote from post

My commentary.

-------------
..

> Newarre is most likely in western Vintas, probably on the southern border of
> the Eld.

The first piece of evidence we have is Kvothe/Kote’s admission that the Scrael
come from the east and his surprise that they’ve “made it this far west yet.”
He “thought the mountains” presumably would have stopped them or slowed
them down.

> Looking at the map, we see that the only significant mountain ranges that
> could have held them back are the Stormwal mountains in the far east and
> possibly the Eastern Cealdish range. Mountains in the Commonwealth are on the

> appear to run north-south.
 
 1. Everything is west of the Stormwal Mountains. However The mountains could be
 the Six Sisters if the Skrall are coming from the Eld. Which is how Kvothe gets
 into the Fae. Also kvothe says "this far west". If were going off 4 corners
 map, the Vintas anything BUT far _west_. It's far _east_.

Someone suggests it's far western, which is good for my theory. I can't find the comment there referencing though.

> This leaves us with three countries that border a sizable mountain range:
> Ceald, Modeg and Vintas.

Kvothe doesn't say the mountain range was sizable.

agreed

This is strong evidence they are in land control by the king of Vint. But where?
The king of vint could have conquered lands between when kote tells his story
and when the map and younger story frame happened. I admit it's unlikely, but a
lot of unlikely this happen thats why it's a story.

It's just as likely that the Vintas people copied the fae.

No, it doesn't. "How is the road to tinue", is likely code phrase.

The eld is likely famous enough to be mentioned anywhere.

A point in favor of Trebon!

in an area controlled by Vintas, likely so. near atur, tinue and eld? i don't
see why that would have to be.

The strongest evidence against it is concerning the currency. Which As i stated
at the start of this theory could be explained by the King conquering lands
around Trebon.

A friend made a good suggestion that we get a mapping from fears to areas from
Ben

Their afraid of Demons in Newarre. Which would put them close to Atur. While not
_in_ Atur, Trebon and likely Newarre is close enough to it to pick up some echos
of it. Especially since Atur controlled those lands in the past.

Another issue is that one of the soldiers colors are of the Maer's house.

> house.

Ok. They don't mention the colors so lets go find them.

----
It's _not_ at the start of the series when chronicler is peacefully robbed.

Likely there referring to this near the end of NOTW:

blue and white

> They wore the Maer ’s colors but beneath their sapphire and ivory 

fair enough, they are wearing the maers colors. This likely means the are the
Maer's men. This could mean Newarre is likely near or in land the Maer controls.
Given there is something of a succession war going on in the background of the
story.

# Getting to Newarre.


<img src="/img/kvothehorse.jpeg" height="300px" width="450px">

So then, where is Newarre? If were right, this is the easy part. First we get to
Trebon, then Mauthen farm and follow it towards the stream and assume it's some
distance beyond that. Feel free to skip to the map a the bottom as this is
mostly book keeping. All of this is from NOTW chapters 70 onward.

Kvothe starts from dockside inn. Somewhere near the Omethi river and the
University.

> “Did you come by way of Marrow?” I asked, picking a northern town at random.

> “No,” the fat one said. “We’re down from Trebon.”


So Trebon, isn't no any official map, so we can't just hope there. Were told you
can reach trebon by the omethi river upstream of the university by a couple
days:

> “How far is it to Trebon?” I asked. “Upriver? A couple days.”

The road must wind a bit more then the river, as it's longer by road:

> “I asked how far,” she snapped at him. “Is it longer than the riverway?”

> “Damn sight longer. About twenty-five leagues by road. A hard road too,
> uphill.”

A league: 2-3.5 miles, that information doesn't seem to help much because no map
has a scale to speak of. Nor likely could we trust one.

Kvothe tells the tinker, who he wouldn't lie to, that he did travel about 70
miles. We assume this leads him close to the omethi, but which side. It's not
clear. But i'm guessing east side, given there is more land there. On the way
back he asks people if there are headed up Imre way, which could imply on Imre
side.

From tinker meeting, Trebon is half mile to north and evesdown docks to the
east.

The only way the docks could be to the east is if kvothe was on the west side of
the Omethi OR if he rounded the bend. If he is on the east side of the Omethi
then all his travels happend in the little tringle between the omethi and the
great stone road. Given he chooses to not use the Great stone road, and my guess
that the map is more accurate this close to the university. Im guessing he didn't
make it to the bend and is on the west side.

Trebon is between a mining and a farming town. The farming town could be
Newarre, but that doesn't help us place it as far as I can tell.

Mauthen farm is about a mile out, I'm guessing North.

They go to "borroill"

the start behind a bluff and then travel into the woods. I don't see any hint at
which direction so this doesn't help

Finally, the end up heading back and towards the bluffs in the north. Im
guessing this means there closer to the split between Ceald that has the
mountain range. But again speculation. So will end up drawing a wide circle

On the map the Green is where It would likely have to be If the theory is
correct. Red is where a more specific guess based on the text and what I think
is more likely.

# Other

Thanks for reading! 

Here is are some bonus sections that are a bit rougher and more abstract.

## not nowhere

Pat is to clever by half. His best tricks are to set up at least three meanings to a phrase or comment. Newarre is no different. The careful observer will note it's similarity to "nowhere". But a madman will note
it's similarity to _new warren_. 

I'm not going to flush the meaning of that here, but I will suggest you ponder the word _warren_. It's use
in the poem at the start of the post that should have lead you here: [Warren Windershins Ways and Woes](2021-1-22-bone-and-crystal). I'll even link the passage in the book that mentions warrens. TMWF:73:494:

> But Denna’s version was different. In her song, Lanre was painted in tragic tones, a hero wrongly
> used. Selitos’ words were cruel and biting, Myr Tariniel a *warren* that was better for the purifying
> fire. Lanre was no traitor, but a fallen hero.

## nowhere at all

I want to quickly Highlight two oddities that are intentional on the authors part but I can't assign meaning to:

1. Simmon comes for a visit.
2. Elodin is in town.

Two visitors that fit the descriptions of Simmon and Wil visit the Inn.

>  Two young men, one sandy-haired, one dark, well dressed and well-spoken.

But that's not where it's stops, the sandy haired one recognizes kvothe when he heard him sing

> was you. I heard you in Imre once. Cried my eyes out afterward. I never heard
> anything like that before or since. Broke my heart.”

Simmon did cry his eyes out. _But wait there is more_

> tapped a finger to his nose

Simmon to likes to tap his noes:

> Simmon pressed on. “Yes. Some say that it’s the ghost of a student who got
> lost in the building and starved to death.” He tapped the side of his nose
> with a finger like an old gaffer telling a story. “They say he wanders the
> halls even to this day, never able to find his way outside.”

He even says "like an old gaffer" which cob is and he does in this rather ominous scene:

> Old Cob tapped the side of his nose speculatively. “You know,” he said to the innkeeper. “You
> should bring in a singer or sommat on nights. Hell, even the Orrison boy can play a bit of his daddy’s
> fiddle. I bet he’d be glad to come in for the price of a couple drinks.” He looked around at the inn. “A

But maybe noes tapping is a regional gesture?

2. Elodin is in town

Kvothe doesn't get along with the local priest:

> “And you don’t get along with Abbe Leodin,” Bast said.
> “And I don’t get along with the local priest,” Kvothe admitted. “But you should make an

Whose last name is a just a quick 2 letter swap to "elodin". 

over all conclusions? Well, maybe Kvothe is trapped within his sleeping mind. Though he doesn't exhibit any of the symptoms.
