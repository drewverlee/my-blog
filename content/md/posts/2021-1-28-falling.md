This post is a continuation of [Turnings](/posts-output/2021-1-26-Turnings). 

This is not the end, there is no end. But will make an ending of this nonetheless. You will 
need to have read u/quoo's theory on soap making

Auri [Auri's soap](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/a5h24v/is_kvothe_fulcrum_from_tsrost/) making has gone all wrong.

The world is spinning around her...

The gear does not move, it is her anchor, her steady rock. Nothing could turn it from true

And yet that' just what she does.

She knows the weight of it, and now so do you.

> Auri sat down hard upon the floor. So sudden-full of sweet relief she gasped.

> She closed her eyes and wept.

Later she sets the Fulcrum upon the Chair. We now know this is the Cthaeh, but what is the Cthaeh?

> As Auri made her

# Epilogue

Pale, Auri, her blue flame casting distant shadows
look how the world spins around her
In fact the whole world spins. 
She stays urchin small.
So as to not be bound to river stone.

She listens, she knows and in her proper ways she tends the Below.

Vorfelan Rhinata Morie

_The Fae is shaped to the listeners desire_

four times she did call her love
four corners she did turn from true
four plates on a greystone she did lay
four pools did her broken tears become

from there depths she did draw him from
and to there darkness she cursed him stay

Weep for her. 
Weep for what should have been.
Weep for what still could be.

we must not look away 
seven words we must say.

I forgive you.

And though I know not them not, 
ten words we must find to break a strong mans will,
and so from the pieces we can build anew.

_Blood, Bracken and bone_
<br>
_seek now the heart of stone_
<br>
_the land sets, the skys a fallow_
<br>
_weep willow, howl sparrow_

_breath deep rivers kiss_
<br>
_look into the deep abyss_
<br>
_we do not call the current cruel_
<br>
_and so forgive our Lady of Misrule_

## and beginnings

Three days, Three acts, A tragedy makes, 
but Daeonica was a five act play
And so we will have another day
boot to stirrup, hand to mane, Kvothe will ride without shadows hame.
