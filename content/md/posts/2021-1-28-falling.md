## moon fae

Pale, Auri, her blue flame casting distant shadows
look how the world spins around her
In fact the whole world spins. 
She stays urchin small.
So as to not be bound to river stone.

She listens, she knows and in her proper ways she tends the Below.

Vorfelan Rhinata Morie

_The Fae is shaped to the listeners desire_

four times she did call her love
four corners she did turn from true
four plates on a greystone she did lay
four pools did her broken tears become

from there depths she did draw him from
and to there darkness she cursed him stay

Weep for her. 
Weep for what should have been.
Weep for what still could be.

we must not look away 
seven words we must say.

I forgive you.

And though I know not them not, 
ten words we must find to break a strong mans will,
and so from the pieces we can build anew.

# Exposition

Rothfuss has given us poetry and mystery. I have tried to bring what craft I
have bare to ensure some of my discoveries are entertaining by doing more
_showing_ then _telling_. But This is the end of the road. From here I'll try to
speak plainly. Let's have an ending then. I'll try to catch the moon and can only
to fail.

Let's start at the beginning, a true beginning, for there is only one
story, only one flame, finally there is only one being. Kvothe tells us its
name:TODO

> “In the beginning, as far as I know, the world was spun out of the nameless
> void by Aleph, who gave everything a name. Or, depending on the version of the
> tale, found the names all things already possessed.”

But one is the loneliest number So Aleph decides to make of itself something
more. Similar to how Kvothe plays seek the stone, he split his mind into two .
He both knew and discovered himself anew in a different way and in so doing spun
out out the world. This is the metaphysical representation of Knowers vs
Shapers. Not people, but acts. Neither good nor bad.

Were told this story from another angle as well in "How Old Holly came to be" OH:

> In the beginning, there was the wood. 

The wood, Holly, is Aleph as well. Aleph knows of the land, the vines, the steam and stone. 
But there was also the Lady. She was Aleph but less and more. She didn't just _know_ she also _shaped_:

> There was also the lady. She was neither. She came to the tower. 
> She turned the earth and made a garden. She cut the other trees 
> and burned them in the tower. 

Shaping isn't evil. It is neither. It is. It is a tool and you must judge for
yourself how its used, not be told. Not by me, by the author or Kvothe.

> These things were neither. None of them were warm or cold. 
> None of them were good or bad. 

But though Aleph was now, two, and could shape as well as know. He thought
little of it, he knew on the edges of his being that the world needs romance,
conflict and growth:

> There was day, which was light. There was night, which was dark. 
> There was the moon, which was both light and dark. 

> There was a man. He was both. He came to the tower. He and 
> the lady sat beneath the holly. They were both beneath the holly. 
> They were both. 

The man knows and shapes and he has passion he sings! But why? why have passion
or song or sweet words? Because he burns inside and flame will not last and so he
seeks to make himself immortal by shaping the world around him.

> The man said to the lady. The man showed to the lady. The man 
> sang to the lady. 

> The man left the tower. The lady left the tower. They both left 
> the tower. Both. 

From here let me summarize, least I recopy the entire book. Every word is
important mind you. The man loved the woman and taught her to love in return.
But a man's drive is to carve out a place, a woman's is to simply be and in so
being while her flesh to fades, the heart of her never truly does. If it helps,
you can drop the genders her and concentrate on the idea's of knowing and
shaping. I don't want suggest all women or men are one way or another. The story
quickly shows how that be the case as the woman griefs for the man who doesn't
return with her. In her grief she cuts a wreath, which was bad. In this story we
see echos of the magic of the current world. She has a piece of Alphe itself, of
deep knowing, not given, but _taken_. With it she can bind and shape creation
itself. Which is what she is doing with her songs. She wants her love back, 
her flame.

Now you must split your mind into three and hold three stories at once. Across time, across space and people. There is only one story.

Our Lady asked three times:

_once_

> She sat beneath the holly and she sang. 

> In the midst of silence Lyra stood by Lanre’s body and spoke his name. Her voice was a commandment. Her voice was steel and stone. Her voice told him to live again. But Lanre lay motionless and dead.

> Auri gripped the neck of Foxen’s bottle in one hand, let go of the stone edge of the pool, and dove beneath the water.

_twice_

> She sat beneath the holly and she sang. 

> In the midst of fear Lyra knelt by Lanre’s body and breathed his name. Her
> voice was a beckoning. Her voice was love and longing. Her voice called him to
> live again. But Lanre lay cold and dead.

> Then she drew three slow, deep breaths, gripped Foxen tight, and dove
> into the pool again.

_three _

> She sat beneath the holly and she sang. 

> In the midst of despair Lyra fell across Lanre’s body and wept his name. Her voice was a whisper. Her voice was echo and emptiness. Her voice begged him to live again. But Lanre lay breathless and dead.

> Auri pulled a breath and dove
> again, her body twisting smoothly, her right hand finding all the friendly
> grips. Down to the dark. The stone. The timber.

But Lanre was dead. 

> Lanre was dead. Lyra wept brokenly and touched his face with trembling hands. 

Auri, our lady, had asked three times which she tells us is proper:

>  She thought of going back. But no. Three times. 

When we let grief overrule our reason, when we turn our backs, our desires take control. 

> All around men turned their heads, because the bloody field was less horrible to look upon than Lyra’s grief.

She would never break the rules for herself, but she would for him. She tells us so:

> Someday he would come, and she would
> tend to him. Someday he would be the one all eggshell hollow empty in the dark.
> And then... Auri smiled. Not for herself. No. Not ever for herself. She must
> stay small and tucked away, wellhidden from the world. But for him it was a
> different thing entire. For him she would bring forth all her desire. She would
> call up all her cunning and her craft. Then she would
> make a name for him. Auri spun about three times.

But she doesn't stop at three times. Which will come back to.

Auri's Underthing has three pools: Yellow, Grey and Silver. They represent and
the three calls the Lady made to bring her Lord back. 

But there is another pool, when where Auri fears to go. Black pool which goes by another name
black door.

> the iron-bound door that led to Boundary.

> So Auri opened wide the iron bound door. So Auri entered Boundary.

Black door, Boundry a place beyond whats right. she goes there when things
are too hard, when she want's for him. A perfect candle, his flame, his life.

Iron-bound black door is represented in Hespe's tale as the iron box Jax used to Trap the moon.
Further driving this home, Auri also has Jax's book of secrets. Auri isn't _Jax_ the moon catcher.
She is amalgamation of Jax though. 

Allow me to weave a story for you. It forms a circle, our ending will be our beginning. A cycle of adventure, love, folly and tragedy. There is no beginning, no ending.

But for it to be a story we must have a beginning. So will start with start with
lonely, hollow Jax. He came from a broken home, Temerant and he walked until he
found a hermit who is analogous to the Cthaeh and Teccam. The Cthaeh, listened and spoke,
but Jax heard what he wanted to hear and so he sought mastery of the moon. He shaped the fae
and caught part of the moons name and bound

He caught part of the moon and bound her to our world, in a box, in house with
many windows. The Fae with the windows as greystones. But only part of her name,
so she was able to travel between mortal and fae. Exactly like Felurian, for she
is part of the moon. Jax didn't ask for her love, _he took_ it. He rapped her.

She is Geisa, the first woman to know the unasked-for touch of a man. She is
Pale Alenta who brings the blight. 




Lyra called a fourth time, and not in the proper way. Her weeping was to terrible,
for Alphe to behold and he bent tell he broke until Lanre was again for here
upon the land. But the price was high, for in order to bring him back she had to 
draw from the very power they had fought against. 

Tehlu is the black beast of Drossen Tor. 

The victor often twists the tale to
suit their needs and i suggest this is what happened here. If this comes as a
shocker then consider we know the tales are confliced right from the start:

> Now Tehlu, who made the world and who is lord over all, watched the world of men.

Who do you think is a more reliable narrator? Trapis? Or Skarpi?


Trapis story paints Tehlu TODO better tehlu story

But there _are no_ demons. Only Fae, and I like Bast. So Tehlu is the lie the
righteous tell as they burn down cities and blame those they chase. down.

Pat nodes to this when he makes this clear when its the guard that beats kvothe
near to death and its a man in Encanis mask that saves him. We can't judge right
and wore by color or creed. Instead look to there deeds. What has the Tehlin
church represent in the story? Progress? Justice? No. Lies and cruelty.

We have come full circle, to Auri's candle making. She pulled from the depths,
the timbre, the wood, Alphe, creation itself, the essences of Lanre and Selitos,
their conflict and passion and given them to Kvothe so that her Lord might live
again.

Auri our Lady of the Blue flame. Who the Adem call Cyphus and Who Skari named as Ordal. TODO

I have woven for you a fairy tale, dark and deep and you would be right to
question. This is rhythm and little reason. So let's continue and clarify as
best we can. The Lady' isn't one person, one continuous perfect story, but
rather a personification, a music, that travels through time and always finds
someone to sing its song. We see echoes of this for both are Lord as they travel
through time. With neither Lanre or Lyra not being the first, but rather the
last.

There is a dance of sorts here through legend. As we see the different perspectives of 
wars and stories blend together and victors adopt the heroic attributes of the losers. 




Perial brings Menda who she loves into the world. Who becomes Tehlu and hunts
Encanis, who is Lanre. Tehlu's black Iron wheel being the being the beast of
black iron whose breath was a darkness that smothered men. Lanre fought the
beast and killed it. Lanre brought victory to his side, but he bought it with
his life. 

But Encanis burned the cities, not defended them? But later its Haliax who is lanre that 







Kvothe gives her the Name Auri, he thinks it means sunny in Siaru, but it
doesn't. The Adem would call Auri "Cyphus", who bears the blue flame, which Auri
calls "Foxen". She the rabbit, him the fox. He burns brightly for her.

> mocking. “You looked ... fierce. Like a wolf with all its hackles up,” she
> stopped, looking up at my head. “Or a fox, I suppose. You’re too red for a

Kvothe lights her way in the dark, he gives her adventure and something to look forward to. 
Skarpi would have called her Ordal:

> the youngest of them all, who had never seen a thing die, stood bravely before

> face was a mask with burning eyes, whose name meant anger.

He would have called Kvothe Andan. TODO why

You should read u/quoo's theory on [Auri's
soap](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/a5h24v/is_kvothe_fulcrum_from_tsrost/)
making. As well as my rambling read through of [The Princess and Mr
Whiffles](TODO). 

I'll start by answering a question that he left:

> Curiously, the text describes the remanents of the separation process using
> allusions to Usnea, Grey Dalcenti, and Pale Alenta. Could the chandrian be
> related to the cast off and discarded portion of each step rather than the
> steps themselves?

The evidence suggests they are the cast off parts used in creating Soap for
Auri. The end product is likely all of the four corners, a magical place of
wonder and excitement, where her love and her can live out their tale over and over...

From the remains of the Soap, the Chandrian, she keeps her self small and
childish and in so doing hides the ugly truths of who she is and what happened
from herself.

From the essence of Lanre, Selitos and likely Laurian (the Laurel tree), she
draws ingredients to build kvothe, the candle and her new flame. For Auri, our
Lady is always with Kvothe in one form or another through out the journey. she is the
binding between the black key, 3 teeth, which represents the moon and the fulcrum, 9 teeth
which are the Ruach who are the Chandrian.

Together they are the twelve and the answer to a curse so mundane that I never even thought to question it:

> Damn Ambrose twelve ways
> Only a twelve-color bastard treats a horse that way.

Separately the explain another curse:

> “Tehlu’s tits and teeth,”

Here the moon, the aspects of the Lady are... well the tits and the Teeth are
our Ruach/Chandrian.

### history

Jax/tehlu steals the moon
tehlu goes around casting demons/killing (parts of the moon) back to the fae bc he wants her all to her self
Lanre/? fights jax and wins
the moon/lady/auri binds lanre's name to hers and jax so lanre can live
but it breaks her further and curses lanre to live out part of jax's goals of killing fae

We have to stop here and comment on the
Chandrians. The Chandrian are the shadows of their counter points. Felurian true
didn't kill parents Troupe or the Mauthen family. But her shadow did. Think of
it this way, you see a man trapped under a wagon. You could lift it, but you
dont. Would you say you killed him? How you think of it doesn't matter, if you
do nothing he dies. So you killed him. This is explained

Ja(X) steals part of the moon, but the part of the Moon that is free can visit
the mortal realm and do as she will. This Part is represented by Felurian. She
is the Moon and all Fae are her offspring. X is anything but jealous and so he
seeks to bring them all back to him. X is called Tehlu in Trapi's story, but is
a confounding of his name by the Amyr. Who see to oppose X and all who follow
him, which are any who try to learn the truth. The reason for this change is
simple, if people knew X's true name _haliax_ they might invoke his name. As it
is, no one talks about X and so he lacks the poor to get beyond the doors of
stone. Trapis story gives us insight into events, but only we pry it apart. 

The beast Lanre stood against was Tehlu. Who I will called HammerX, to avoid confusion and highly the confounding

> It was a great beast with scales of black iron, whose breath was a darkness that smothered men. Lanre fought the beast and killed it. Lanre brought victory to his side, but he bought it with his life.

Note the scale are black Iron as is HammerX wheel

> All night he worked, and when the first light of the tenth morning touched him, Tehlu struck the wheel one final time and it was finished. Wrought all of black iron, the wheel stood taller than a man.

Skarpi says "whose breath was a darkness that smothered men"

The beast of drossen tor _smothered_, HammerX _quenched_, those words are synonyms:

> But not all were men. When Tehlu struck the fourth, there was the sound of quenching iron and the smell of burning leather. For the fourth man had not been a man at all, but a demon wearing a man’s skin. When it was revealed, Tehlu grabbed the demon and broke it in his hands, cursing its name and sending it back to the outer darkness that is the home of its kind.

Trapis Encanis is vaguely represents the shape of Haliax. But the burning of the 6 citiies are the same in both. Except they aren't 
cities, they are forests. They are parts of the Fae. Myr Tariniel burning is described here as "ring of iron" and "breaking stone"

TODO selitos likely Encanis. 

> The white walls were charred black and the fountains ran with blood. For a night and a day Selitos stood helpless beside Lanre and could do nothing more than watch and listen to the screams of the dying, the ring of iron, the crack of breaking stone.

And also in Trapis story, were given the ring of iron and shattered stone. 

> The wheel rung again, like a great bell tolling long and deep. Encanis threw his body tight against the chains again and the sound of his scream shook the earth and shattered stones for half a mile in each direction.

The cries of the dying are the trees and the fae among them. 


TODO 6 cities burned in 

> Encanis thrashed on the wheel and began to howl as the iron burned and bit and froze him.
> To Tehlu the sound was like a sweet music.



> Maybe the soft creaking of your tendons as you
> clench your fists is like a sweet symphony to me. Oh yes it is. And you can be sure.


> Encanis thrashed on the wheel and began to howl as the iron burned and bit and froze him.


Trapis story of Tehlu is a misrepresentation of events with the names intentionally confounded through history by the Amyr. 
The Chruch is the dominating power in Atur, did we assume any part of there history wouldn't be under the Amyr's control?

>     Nina nodded easily. “It seemed the best thing, since an angel gave me the dream. And they can’t lock the church up properly at night, since you tore off the front of the building, and killed that demon.” She reached over and brushed at the paper with a finger. “It hain’t that hard. All you need to do is take a knife and scrape at it a bit and all the words come off.” She pointed. “I was careful never to scrape off Tehlu’s name though.

## interlude: The Dog and the Shadow

The Dog and the Shadow A Dog was crossing a plank bridge over a stream with a
piece of meat in his mouth, when he happened to see his own reflection in the
water. He thought it was another dog with a piece of meat twice as big; so he
let go his own, and flew at the other dog to get the larger piece. But, of
course, all that happened was that he got neither; for one was only a shadow,
and the other was carried away by the current.
