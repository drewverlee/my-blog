> “It is a word. Words are pale shadows of forgotten names. As names have power, words have power. Words can light fires in the minds of men. Words can wring tears from the hardest hearts. There are seven words that will make a person love you. There are ten words that will break a strong man’s will. But a word is nothing but a painting of a fire. A name is the fire itself.”

## Rhythm: Words can wring tears from the hardest hearts

_My heart aches_ 

> After the battle was finished and the enemy was set beyond the doors of stone, survivors found Lanre’s body, cold and lifeless near the beast he had slain. Word of Lanre’s death spread quickly, covering the field like a blanket of despair. They had won the battle and turned the tide of the war, but each of them felt cold inside. The small flame of hope that each of them cherished began to flicker and fade. Their hopes had hung on Lanre, and Lanre was dead.

_the truth burns in me like a fire_ 

> In the midst of silence Lyra stood by Lanre’s body and spoke his name. Her voice was a commandment. Her voice was steel and stone. Her voice told him to live again. But Lanre lay motionless and dead.

_i cant breath_

> In the midst of fear Lyra knelt by Lanre’s body and breathed his name. Her voice was a beckoning. Her voice was love and longing. Her voice called him to live again. But Lanre lay cold and dead.

_I scream_

> In the midst of despair Lyra fell across Lanre’s body and wept his name. Her voice was a whisper. Her voice was echo and emptiness. Her voice begged him to live again. But Lanre lay breathless and dead.

_But I do not look away_

> Lanre was dead. Lyra wept brokenly and touched his face with trembling hands. All around men turned their heads, because the bloody field was less horrible to look upon than Lyra’s grief.

_Lyra who was, and is and ever will be. My heart. My chaos._

## Reason: The turning of the world 

Lyra was and is a powerful namer, but she never brought Lanre back. Using her Alar she split her mind into 7 pieces and
transferred her will into 7 people including lanre and herself. 

Together, as seven, she commanded some of the many names (signs) of death, and so she to halted it. But Lanre was dead, she could halt decay, but not restore it. 
She locked her true nature along with selitos, lanre and alphe beyond the doors of stone. She must convince every next generation to do the same.

## Reason: 

The ordered choas of the word is broken by mankins power of narrative. We must hold to and opposite ideals in our minds
It is and we are.

Many of you are aware of one side of being. The four corners. Order. Structure. Its comfortable to talk about, to share, to touch.
To contrast, Chaos binds and breaks. It cannot be given, it must be taken. This is why the [nature](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/k7xfvv/what_a_plant_knows/) of Faeriniel eludes so many. 

A fern has a cyclical growth and rebirth cycle. It grows new foliage and lets the old die so it can learn and evolve. Haliax doesn't represent
order or chaos, light or darkness. He represents a breaking of the cycle.

The choas that is necessary to break in order to build anew. _our anger_. You cannot be woefully ignorant of your true
nature.

_Look ..LOOK DAMN YOU_
Look around you, the world is fire. Our fire. Our Laws. Our Choice.

> Seven words that will make a person love you

I forgive you. 

> There are ten words that will break a strong man’s will.

We must find the ten words that will break a man's will. So we can build are selves anew. I don't know what they are, but i suspect will find the
on the road to Tinue.
