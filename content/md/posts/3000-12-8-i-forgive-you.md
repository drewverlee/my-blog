## Reason (prelude): warnings and broken boards

Before we start. Must caution you that this post _might_ be the equivalent of Bredon Bashing Kvothe around the tak board. If that reference isn't immediately obvious to you, turn back now.

The King killer chronicle journey is powerful, it moves the heart, it tears stone from the mountains.  Its best if you experience
it yourself, rather me rob you of the joy.  Journey before destination. What follows is more akin to a cheat code. I suggest you read only if you believe you have reached the end of the journey as i have. Hopefully, together will find out i'm wrong.

> "He gestured at the brief and brutal lay of stones between us. “Look at that. Why would I ever want to win a game such as this?”

> I looked down at the board. “The point isn’t to win?” I asked.

> “The point,” Bredon said grandly, “is to play a beautiful game.” He lifted his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beatific smile. “Why would I want to win anything other than a beautiful game?”



## Rhythm (prelude): fire and shadows

> “It is a word. Words are pale shadows of forgotten names. As names have power, words have power. Words can light fires in the minds of men. Words can wring tears from the hardest hearts. There are seven words that will make a person love you. There are ten words that will break a strong man’s will. But a word is nothing but a painting of a fire. A name is the fire itself.”

## Rhythm: Words can wring tears from the hardest hearts

_My heart aches_ 

> After the battle was finished and the enemy was set beyond the doors of stone, survivors found Lanre’s body, cold and lifeless near the beast he had slain. Word of Lanre’s death spread quickly, covering the field like a blanket of despair. They had won the battle and turned the tide of the war, but each of them felt cold inside. The small flame of hope that each of them cherished began to flicker and fade. Their hopes had hung on Lanre, and Lanre was dead.

_the truth burns in me like a fire_ 

> In the midst of silence Lyra stood by Lanre’s body and spoke his name. Her voice was a commandment. Her voice was steel and stone. Her voice told him to live again. But Lanre lay motionless and dead.

_i cant breath_

> In the midst of fear Lyra knelt by Lanre’s body and breathed his name. Her voice was a beckoning. Her voice was love and longing. Her voice called him to live again. But Lanre lay cold and dead.

_I scream_

> In the midst of despair Lyra fell across Lanre’s body and wept his name. Her voice was a whisper. Her voice was echo and emptiness. Her voice begged him to live again. But Lanre lay breathless and dead.

_But I do not look away_

> Lanre was dead. Lyra wept brokenly and touched his face with trembling hands. All around men turned their heads, because the bloody field was less horrible to look upon than Lyra’s grief.

_Lyra who was, and is and ever will be. My heart. My chaos._

## Reason: to stop death and decay

Lyra was and is a powerful namer, but she never brought Lanre back. Using her Alar she split her mind into at least 7 pieces and
transferred her will into 7 people including lanre and herself.

Together, the seven commanded some of the many names (signs) of decay/death, and so she to halted them. But Lanre was dead, she could halt decay, but not restore life or if she did, the cost was at her own soul. And lanre is nothing without Lyra. One heart, one soul. Lyra stole decay from faerinel. Our princess auri. Secret roots of the world. 

look with your eyes. See with your heart.

Roots turned to fungus by Lyra's love.

Auri never leaves the university. She lives in dark places. Staying, not leaving, not maturing she stays always playfully young because her nature has been stolen. 

Her name is slow growth.

Her name bends in the wind.

Her name is darkness and cold.

Her name is ["here"](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/k74f9l/translating_auris_name/).

_Weep for her, weep at the loss of what should have been_

### Rhythm: to stop life and death

If a plant can't decay, shed its older parts, it can't grow. Faeriniel is crippled. 

> The Cthaeh gave a thin, dry chuckle. “Blood, bracken, and bone, I wish you creatures had the wit to appreciate me. Whatever else you might forget, remember what I just said. Eventually you’ll get the joke. I guarantee. You’ll laugh when the time comes.”

We assume the Cthaeh  is talking about the Stick by the Maer. But they give us a deeper trut.

_Blood and bones are to braken_

The power of the Barnsley fern algorithm isn't easy to approach. Here is [blog post](http://blog.alex-turok.com/2013/08/clojure-barnsley-fern.html) where its implemented. The Post is under a series called "Courage". The author trembles at the sight of it:

> Sincerely speaking, I can’t say what makes me fear the task of creating such a simple thing.

This is real, this is skin with flesh and bones beneath. Feel the spiral inward on itself towards infinity.

Here is me explaining how it defines the nature of the [world](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/k7xfvv/what_a_plant_knows/) Not just world Rothfuss has created. But our own. 

_my stomach clenches, i run into the darkness, i do not look behind_

## Reason: destination before Journey

Alphe was never supposed to reach the moon, in the algorithm, when the stem/alphe gets to moon/selitos (the grey dots above). There is another starting place chosen and you start over again. over and over to infinity. Alphe defied this, he kept the moon. He refused to move on. He halted progress, expansion outward. He broke the turnings of the world

## Rhythm: The turnings of the world

# TODO map

the road bends/ old holly bends to steer off its straight path to be blocked at the four plate door.
The reft, centhe sea, cutting off part of who lanre is from the rest of the world. from who he was meant to
be.

## Rhythm:  But a word is nothing but a painting of a fire.

## Reason:  A name is the fire itself

The ordered choas of the word is broken by mankins power of narrative. We must hold to and opposite ideals in our minds
It is and we are.

Many of you are aware of one side of being. The four corners. Order. Structure. Its comfortable to talk about, to share, to touch.
To contrast, Chaos binds and breaks. It cannot be given, it must be taken. This is why the [nature](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/k7xfvv/what_a_plant_knows/) of Faeriniel eludes so many. 

A fern has a cyclical growth and rebirth cycle. It grows new foliage and lets the old die so it can learn and evolve. Haliax doesn't represent
order or chaos, light or darkness. He represents a breaking of the cycle.

The choas that is necessary to break in order to build anew. _our anger_. You cannot be woefully ignorant of your true
nature.

_Look ..LOOK DAMN YOU_
Look around you, the world is fire. Our fire. Our Laws. Our Choice.

> Seven words that will make a person love you

I forgive you. 

> There are ten words that will break a strong man’s will.

We must find the ten words that will break a man's will. So we can build are selves anew. I don't know what they are, but i suspect will find the
on the road to Tinue. 

## Credit where credit is due

* My father, brother and mother for listening.
* My wife for being.
* My dog for never letting me forget to play.
* My wife who smiles even when times are hard. 

Finally, thank you to Patrick Rothfuss. 
For giving me the greatest story ever told.
