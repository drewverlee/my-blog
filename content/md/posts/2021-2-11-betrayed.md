_Watch the stars as they're dancin'_

_Like I'm caught in a trance and..._
<br>


_I will steal every one for you_
<br>
_See you on the horizon_
<br>
_I will be lightenin'_
<br>
_I will fly through the night for you_

_To tell you the truth_
<br>
_I'd die for you_
<br>
_I'm at the door screaming_
<br>
_Take me now!_

## Intro

This post is a continuation of [Warren Widdershins Ways and
Woes](/posts-output/2021-1-15-bone-and-crystal) and it and it's precursors
should be read first. The price of admission here is high and the reward is not honey sweet.

### TODO

You should recall from Auri's trip to
[Newarre](/posts-output/2021-1-23-how-to-get-to-newarre) that her Candle
making concluded on Cendling, as if it couldn't be any other way. As if the
god's made it so.... but we know different. There are no gods. 

Auri wasn't ideal before her trip to Newarre, not by a twig or an oak tree.
The Underthing won't tend to itself, and what if things were to break? Clamor and Calamity.

So she moves things to their proper places, she opens doors that want opening
and avoid those to shy or to black to consider.

On her first day

## Credits

To u/drue801 who got the heart of the
[story](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/ez5qyi/auri_why/)
correct. Why Auri? Such an important question. Maybe the question that lies at the heart of 
the world. Auri is taking medication to ease her pain and her accounting there is
accurate. She also played her role in Kvothe's admissions troubles, but not in the time frame that
Drue purposed. If anything, her insight is more clever for having judged the character and shape of the 
plot correctly, if the exact date and means.
