## Intro

This post is a continuation of [Blood Beneath](/posts-output/2021-2-11-below)
and it and it's precursors should be read first. What follows is another look
into Auri as she slides, skids and bustles here way through another day. Our
last look was unsettling and I sorry to tell you thing's aren't going to get better
any time soon. That part is up to us. Will have to find out way through the dark.

Note, citations are as follows "Book:Chapter:page:Auri Day:Day". Consult the
section at the end for more. This is useful for keeping track of time between
events. Occasionally, I'll add Auri's location as well at the end.

## The price of admission

You should recall from Auri's trip to
[Newarre](/posts-output/2021-1-23-how-to-get-to-newarre) that her Candle
making concluded on Cendling, as if Tehlu willed it, as if it couldn't be any other way. 
By Auri's estimations Kvothe came early, she expected him on the _7th day_ but 6 was the 
lucky number. How easy it is to fool ourselves.... But she also expected him to only have one gift!
Friendly falling fulcrum simple shattering shows the way of things.

> --SROST:9:134:A6:10:2072

But she learns that **much later** on her 6th day (Cendling), just in the nick of time! Until then she
is all a tangle and a bustle. She was busy and at least three bees. She needs a
gift for him. This she sets to it with a will, eyeing everything emphatically: 

> A nice thing to

> was bright with better bright beneath, like copper-gilded gold. 
> 
> --SROST:1:23:A1:D5:PORT


So from buckles to gears she turns over all tings looking for that perfect gift for him.

She is nearly tipsy from all that looking. But the world doesn't stop just
because there is a man, oh no. The Underthing won't tend to itself. What if
things were to break? Clamor and Calamity. Boot's on stairs coming down... It
must not happen.

So she moves things to their proper places, she opens doors that want opening
and avoid those to shy or to black or brackish to consider. Let's now follow her
to Wains, a wondrous place in her underground world. It has a colorful fresco,
where she opens the 9th door for the first time and finds a _sitting room_. But
we won't rest there for now, instead we follow her up the _broken stars_ and
into _Tumbrel_.

There she finds everything a apetalous young lady might need for a night out on the town.

> In the unfallen portion of the room, there was a
> triune mirror vanity and a dark wooden wardrobe taller than a tall woman

> She glimpsed a dozen dresses there, all **velvet** and embroidery. **Shoes**. A robe of

> The vanity was a rakish thing: garrulous and unashamed. The top was scattered

Velvet is a soft, luxurious fabric that is characterized by a dense pile of
evenly cut fibers that have a smooth nap. You often see it used with rich dark
colors like burgundy.

Much later (but will mention it now) she will note the vanity also contains some gloves.

<img src="/img/bur-dress.jpg" height="350px" width="350px">

Such lovely items, feel the sly softness of the gloves. Imagine what they might
feel like against... Ahem.. sorry. Let's move on.

On her second day we followed her to Newarre. On the third day she _wept_ (we have all had those kinds of days) and we 
see here again on the fourth day, though she is still, if you will forgive the expression,  a _bit of mess_. She needs music, laughter
and fire.

> -- SROST:5:80:1246

But her gift isn't ready. Not proper at all.

Auri has so little time and she is so little herself. She is so hollow and empty and
upset with all of everything. Without music or love, with darkness as your only
neighbor what else can any of us turn to? ...she gets something to eat of course, what were you expecting?

She heads to Tree, which has more tools then treats, more the pity. She eats a turnip
and her last fit. She is visited by the smell of nutmeg, which seems reasonable, there are nutmeg pittems
in the room.

We have reached another turning point. From here things start to blur, gold into
black. Forming a haze, a _hole_, wanting for all the world to feel the
safety of strong hands, the caress of soft skin and the promise of a bright
morning. But darkness comes before the light, and cannot mend what we do not understand. 

_onward we go then._

<img src="/img/abstract-plum.png" height="400px" width="400px">

----------

Kvothe, on the _same day_, at Ankers, can relate to the sudden smell of nutmeg in the air.

> I could suddenly smell nutmeg and plum.

> -- TMWF:1:64:A4:D8

He is inadvertently iridescent, He will have
things to rights. It's Auri that's amiss and missing the notes the world is
playing for her.  It's admissions day for Kvothe, he will dazzle the masters
and shortly be off to see Auri. But she _needs_ more time. It simply won't do...

So a young lady does what she must, whiners fuss, but winers now the way of things, 
some times you have to crush a few grapes to turn things to sweet...

Auri washed her face her hand her feet. She put on her new unashmed embroidered
burgundy dress and matching glove. Combed golden hair with Ivory and wood and
wood. She dusted her self delicately with powers, just enough color to give
herself a healthy look, well, maybe a bit more then healthy, she has a heartbeat
and who can blame a girl. She touched her eyebrows delicately with brushes,
though out of practice, it's like riding a horse... she picked lovely dark eye
paint full of midnight star gazing and secret glances. Finally she dawned her
brackets and rings and one more thing.... will cover later.

She went from beneath the Underthing up on top of things, all a glamoured,
adorned and asweat. Auri cheated time and fate, seeing him early and giving
herself wiggle room to find his gifts... She regrets it,
oh the improper nature of the world forces her to be wicked at times. Her eyes
are red and she is ridged. She has cried like a turned spigot and Auri knows all
about pipes and turnings. Knows all about the kinds of mess a spill can make.
She hates _hates_ the way it must be. She is wishes the cruel way of it would
_fall into the dark and die._

The conclusion here is heartbreaking and bitter. We want darkness to be an angry
bear, a restless beast and nameless face. But it's here, it's within us. It's
lost love, it's lonely nights, tangled thoughts, and desperate hopeless need. It's a mirror...

Auri isn't ever cruel... no, that's not true. She can be that, we all can. But
she is that and more. She is also beautiful and broken. She comes to Kvothe, she
knows all is not right...

She came in the night on either felling or her unnamed day, she brought him... a
stone of regret and the comfort of touch. Some of the motives are clear, the
means are within Auri's grasp, the time and locations are within reason. Though
we might not want to admit it, the story remains It does not go simply because
we wish to see it.

## the details in the devil

Were ragging and weary, but we must have a full accounting. To do that we must
talk a bit about Devi and Ambrose. Or at least I must acknowledge there roles and relationships.

> “What’s more,” I said, meeting her eye. “It is entirely possible that my irrational behavior might
> have been partially due to the lingering effect of an **alchemical poison** I was subjected to earlier this
> term.”
> Devi’s expression went stiff. “What?”

> She hadn’t known then. That was something of a relief. “Ambrose arranged to have me dosed with
> the plum bob about an hour before my admissions interview,” I said. “And you sold him the formula.”
> “You have a lot of gall!” Devi’s pixie face was outraged and indignant, but it wasn’t convincing.
> She was off balance and trying too hard.
> 
> “What I have,” I said calmly, “is the lingering taste of plum and nutmeg in my mouth, and the
> occasional irrational desire to choke people for doing nothing more offensive than jostling me on the
> street.”
> Her false outrage fell away. “You can’t prove anything,” she said.
> “I don’t need to prove anything,” I said. “I have no desire to see you in trouble with the masters or
> up against the iron law.” I looked at her. “I just thought you might be interested in the fact that I was
> poisoned.”
> Devi sat very still. She fought to maintain her composure, but guilt was creeping onto her
> expression. “Was it bad?”
> “It was,” I said quietly.
> Devi looked away and crossed her arms in front of her chest. “I didn’t know it was for Ambrose,”
> she said. “Some rich tosh came around. Made a stunningly good offer. . . .”
> She looked back at me. Now that the chilly anger had left her, she looked surprisingly small. “I’d
> never do business with Ambrose,” she said. “And I didn’t know it was for you. I swear.”
> “You knew it was for someone,” I said.
> 
> -- TMMF:42:310

What's important note is that Devi claims a rich tosh came around to buy it.
Kvothe assumes it wasn't Ambrose directly, which is likely the case. As an aside, [tosh](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tosh) is an interesting word. 

It's used once more when Kvothe refers to Ambrose:

> “Rich tosh. Get whatever yeh can off him, that’s what I say.” 
>
> -- TMWF:147:965

There are enough
meanings to the word that it would be had for me to make a persuasive claim on
which one was intended by Rothfuss. Could it be derive from
the British etymology and mean _crown, a 5 shilling silver coin_, the slang
_rubbish?_ Or he Scottish use _to make tidy_. It doesn't give us much to go on.

The deal was for at _least_ a full set of books._

> But the fellow offered me a full set of the Vautium Tegnostae.” She waved to
> the bookshelves. “Normally I’d never make something like that, but unexpurgated copies are just
> impossible to find.”
> 
> -- TMMF:42:311

Unexpurgated, meaning _uncensored_. I'm terrible curious what those books might
be about and who would censoring them. She lets Kvothe look through them, so he knows. My quick attempts at
translation yielded nothing. Nor are they mentioned again.

Kvothe finds out Devi made the plum bob her self.

> I turned to look at her, surprised. “You made it for him?”
> “It’s better than handing over the formula,” Devi said defensively.
> Part of me felt like I should be angry, but the majority of me was simply happy that I was warm and
> dry, with no threat of death hanging over me. I shrugged it off. “Simmon says you can’t factor worth
> half a damn,” I said conversationally.
> 
> -- TMMF:42:311

What in the world gives him the idea Devi didn't intend the lingering effects. We have some vague
sense that Auri got involved to buy herself more time for making her candle. Our rich tosh could have been
hired by Amborse and then passed it off to Auri, playing the role of distraught vengefully Modegan

Likely many of you are busy tearing your hair out thinking of the obvious
differences physical differences between those from Modeg and Auri. Kvothe never comments on the Modegan woman's skin
tone, so will assume its typically. The stories suggest Modegan's are typically olive or have darker complexions. Fela
certainly isn't pale like Auri:

> “Keh,” Wil said. “Too pale. Fela. 
> 
> -- TMWF:All this knowing.

 <img src="/img/fela-headshot.jpg" height="350px" width="300px">
 
 This is likely an issue an clever girl, and Auri is that in spades, could
 overcome with the powders on her new found vanity. Especially to trick a drowsy
 young man whose mind is on admissions. But I'll go as far to suggest that Auri
 is more then wise in the ways of womenly enchanment. She also likely knows a
 bit of [_fae craft_](/posts-output/2021-1-22-bitter-brew). She thinks of
 [Alchemy](/posts-output/2021-1-23-alchemy) in terms of _art_ and _craft_ the
 same words used by Bast to describe the magic fae do. 
 
> Whoever wrought and factored this was living proof that alchemy was **art**.
> It showed pure mastery of **craft**. --Auri SROST:2:52

She can use waystones, so imagine the kinds of places she might have visited and
who she might have talked to along the way. With just a touch of glammourie she
would likely slide past most people with ease. Which is likely why she can't bare to 
look in the flickering light of the mirror as it shows her for who she truly is...

> In the **shifting light** she saw it had a
> sinister bent, and caught a glimpse of what was turning it from true. She could
> feel the tattered edges of its disarray. -- Auri SROST:4:91::A4:D8:Tumbrel 

Shifting light seems to undo glammouries effects, which we learn from Bast:

> Beneath the water, a careful observer might note the young man’s legs looked
> somewhat … odd. But it was shady there, and everyone knows that water bends
> light strangely, making things look other than they are. 
> But it was shady there, and everyone knows that water **bends light**
> strangely, making things look other than they are.
> 
> -- Bast TLT:749

But while Kvothe's waking mind might be tricked, his sleeping mind tries to give him a hint,
as it likens her eye's to a turned on **spigot**. But even without that, were left
with a more then a scattered puzzle pieces. That we don't know the picture it's
forming doesn't discount the fit even if it leaves us a bit tight in the throat.

The timelines sync, Auri has the wardrobe: dress, gloves, powders and eyeliner.
Making pale golden hair into curly blonde doesn't even require glamor, which I
suspect she has more then a passing knowledge of. We have motive, even if
abstract. However, were left with more whys then why we started.

## Epilogue

> “Nothing but the truth could break me. What is harder than the truth?”

> -- Kvothe NOTW:6:47

All this, the trip to Newarre, explaining the magic, traveling with
Auri through the Underthing. Hearing her struggled breath, watching breathless as she
does the unthinkable....

All this. A prelude, a curtain, a door. We find our hands pressed firmly upon
it's black surface. Though to push it open or keep what's inside out, we know
not. The pressure builds and our heart beat drowns out everything. We relax,
draw ourselves into the heart of stone, and look again. Their is no door, only
darkness, we hear the first notes of melody in the distance. It lays deep in the
stone archway, in the cold clear light of the moon and in the bare feet of a
tiny broken girl. It's the broken luting lonely sound of a woman waiting for love, 
her tiny figure casting [shadows on the Wal.](/posts-output/2021-2-15-finding)
