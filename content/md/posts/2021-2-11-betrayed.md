## Intro: The sound a tear makes

This post is a continuation of [Blood Beneath](/posts-output/2021-2-11-below) and it and it's precursors
should be read first. TODO

_Note all quotes are in the section *Citations* at the end._

## TODO

You should recall from Auri's trip to
[Newarre](/posts-output/2021-1-23-how-to-get-to-newarre) that her Candle
making concluded on Cendling, as if it couldn't be any other way. 

Auri wasn't ideal before her trip to Newarre, not by a twig or an oak tree.
The Underthing won't tend to itself, and what if things were to break? Clamor and Calamity.

So she moves things to their proper places, she opens doors that want opening
and avoid those to shy or to black to consider.


Her first day is a finding day, she does that in spades. But will focus on one leg of her journey.

It


Let's follow her to Wains, with it's colorful fresco, where she opens the 9th
door for the first time and finds a _sitting room_. But we won't
rest there for now, instead we follow her up the _broken stars_ and into _Tumbrel_.

There she finds everything a apetalous young lady might need for a night out on the town. SROST:1:31:

> In the unfallen portion of the room, there was a
> triune mirror vanity and a dark wooden wardrobe taller than a tall woman
> standing on her toes. Auri peered shyly through the wardrobe’s half-open doors.
> She glimpsed a dozen dresses there, all **velvet** and embroidery. **Shoes**. A robe of
> silk. Some gauzy bits of the sort the women wore in the frescoes down in Wains.
> The vanity was a rakish thing: garrulous and unashamed. The top was scattered
> with pots of **powders, small brushes, sticks of eyepaint. Bracelets and rings.**
> Combs of *horn and ivory and wood***.There were pins and pens and a dozen bottles,
> some substantial, some delicate as petals.

Velvet is a soft, luxurious fabric that is characterized by a dense pile of
evenly cut fibers that have a smooth nap. You often see it used with rich dark
colors like burgundy.

Much later, but will mention it here, will note the vanity also contains some gloves.

SROST:6:TODO:1531
> She removed the pair of *gloves* from the right-hand
> drawer and set them near the mirror by a pot of *rouge*.

On her second day we followed her to Newarre. On the third day she _wept_ and we 
see here again on the fourth day, though she is still a mess. She needs music, laughter
and fire. SROST:5:80:1246

> She had been sitting like this, empty as eggshell. Hollow and chest-heavy in the
> angry dark when she’d first heard him playing. Back before he’d given her her
> sweet new perfect name. A piece of sun that never left her. It was a bite of
> bread. A flower in her heart. Thinking of this made it easier for her to stand.

But her gift isn't ready. Not proper at all. SROST:5:81:1257

> Three days. He would come visiting in three short
> days. And for all her work and wander, she hadn’t found a proper present for him
> yet. For all that she was wise about the way of things, she hadn’t caught an

> share. It simply wouldn’t do.

We have reached a turning point. From here things start to smuge, white into
black. Forming a a grey, a haze, a _hole_ wanting for all the world to feel the
safety of strong hands, the caress of soft skin and the promise of a bright
morning. But darkness comes before the dark, and cannot mend what we do not understand. 

_onward we go then._

Auri has so little time and she is so little herself. She is so hollow and empty and
upset with all of everything. Without music or love, with darkness as your only
neighbor what else can any of us turn to?

Kvothe, on the _same day_ can relate to the feeling. TMWF:1:64

A young lady does what she must, he is bringing three things and so must she. She _needs_ more time.

Auri washed her face her hand her feet. She put on her new unashmed embroidered
burgundy dress and matching glove. Combed golden hair with Ivory and wood and
wood. She dusted her self delicately with powers, just enough color to give
herself a healthy look, well, maybe a bit more then healthy, she has a heartbeat
and who can blame a girl. She touched her eyebrows delicately with brushes,
though out of practice, it's like riding a horse... she picked lovely dark eye
paint full of midnight star gazing and secret glances. Finally she dawned her
brackets and rings and one more thing.... will cover later.

We want darkness to be an angry bear, a restless beast and nameless face. But
it's here, it's within us. It's lost love, it's lonely nights and desperate
hopeless need. It's a mirror...

Auri isn't hateful or cruel. She is beautiful and broken. She comes to Kvothe, she knows all is not right...

Were ragging and weary, but we must have a full accounting. To do that we must
talk a bit about Devi and a bit about [Glammourie and Grammarie](/posts-output/2021-1-22-bitter-brew).

## Auri why?

u/drue801 titled her piece that touched on this [Why Auri?](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/ez5qyi/auri_why/) 
The comments are largely depressing
I know why and now you start to see the edges of it. 

It is the first note of the song that burns in me.

## Credits

To u/drue801 who got the heart of the
[story](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/ez5qyi/auri_why/)
correct. I needed to recap it, make some important corrections and add necessary details, otherwise a simple citation would have sufficed.

TODO move
Why Auri? Such an important question. Maybe the question that lies at the heart of 
the world. Auri is taking medication to ease her pain and her accounting there is
accurate. She also played her role in Kvothe's admissions troubles, but not in the time frame that
Drue purposed. If anything, her insight is more clever for having judged the character and shape of the 
plot correctly, if the exact date and means. 

## Citations

citations are as follows: Book:Chapter:page

TODO add instead of having everywhere


### reference

Its likely the pages are inconstant between books.

* TWMF : The wise man's fears
* NOTW : Name of the Wind
* OH   : How old holly came to Be from "Unfettered"
* TLT  : The Lighting Tree from "Rouges"
* SROST: Slow Regard of Silent Things
* HOT  : History of Tak

Note i'll be citing the books OH and TLT by just Book::Page leaving out the
chapter sense each story is just one chapter itself

Bonus books, it would be proper to have them, but not strictly necessary:

* RMVDD: Rick and Mortry vs Dugeons and Dragons
* TDDB : The Adventures of Mr. Whiffles and the Pinrcess in The Dark Deep Below
* TTBB : The Adventures of Mr. Whiffles and the Princess in The Thing Beneath the Bed

SROST Chapters so I can use numbers:

1. The Far Below Bottom of things
2. what a look entails
3. beautiful and broken
4. A quite uncommon pleasant place
5. hollow
6. The angry dark
7. ash and ember
8. all to her desire
9. the graceful way to move
10. the hidden heart of things
