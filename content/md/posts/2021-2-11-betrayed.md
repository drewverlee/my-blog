-- "To tell you the Truth" ~ written by wolves.

## Intro

This post is a continuation of [Blood Beneath](/posts-output/2021-2-11-below)
and it and it's precursors should be read first. What follows is another look
into Auri as she slides, skids and bustles here way through another day. Our
last look was unsettling and I sorry to tell you thing's are going to get better
any time soon. That part is up to us. Will have to find Auri in the dark and see
if we can make it back out.

Note, citations are as follows "Book:Chapter:page:Auri Day:Day" This is useful
for keeping track of time between events. It connects the two timelines and so you
can infer between the two. Occasionally i'll add Auri's location at the end


## The price of admission

You should recall from Auri's trip to
[Newarre](/posts-output/2021-1-23-how-to-get-to-newarre) that her Candle
making concluded on Cendling, as if God willed it, as if it couldn't be any other way. 
By Auri's estimations Kvothe came early, she expected him on the _7th day_ but 6 was the 
lucky number. How easy it is to fool ourselves.... But she also expected him to only have one gift!
Friendly falling fulcrum simple shattering shows the way of things.

> If anything her grin grew wider then. Oh. Oh. Oh. Of course. It wasn’t something
> she was looking for. No wonder all her searching was for naught. No wonder
> everything was canted wrong. It was three things. He was bringing three, and so
> must she. Three perfect threes would be her gift for him. Auri’s brow furrowed
> and she turned to look back up the stairs. --SROST:9:134:A6:10:2072

But she learns that much later on her 6th day which is Cendling, just in time! Until then she
is all a tangle and a bustle. She was busy and at least three bees. She needs a
gift for him. This she sets to with a will, eyeing everything emphatically: 

> A nice thing to
> have settled early on, his gift all ready with his visit days away. Auri eyed
> the buckle sharply. Was it a proper gift for him? He was a tangled sort. And he
> was much hidden, too. Nodding, she reached out to touch the cool dark metal. But
> no. It didn’t suit him. She should have known. He was not a one for fastening.
> For holding closed. Neither was he dark. Oh no. He was emberant. Incarnadine. He
> was bright with better bright beneath, like copper-gilded gold. --SROST:1:23:A1:D5:PORT

So from buckles to gears she turns over all tings looking for that perfect gift for him.

> Auri staggered just a bit, all sudden dizzy. After it passed, she walked
> slowly to Cricklet and took a long, deep drink. She felt the cool water run all
> along her insides with nothing to stop it. She felt hollow inside. Her stomach
> was an empty fist. Her feet wanted to go to Applecourt, but she knew there were
> no apples left. He wouldn’t be waiting there, anyway. Not until the seventh day.
> Which was good, really. She had nothing suitable to share. Nor nothing halfway
> good enough to be a proper gift. --SROST:1:436:A2:6

So much so she is nearly dizzy from it.


But the world doesn't stop just because there is a man, oh no. The Underthing
won't tend to itself. What if things were to break? Clamor and Calamity.

So she moves things to their proper places, she opens doors that want opening
and avoid those to shy or to black or brackish to consider. From our last look,
we suspect Auri might be doing something to ease the pain. Though we know not
for sure it's cause or cure addiction, alchemy or other. But we can leave that
for now and focus on one part of her journey.

So, let's follow her to Wains, with it's colorful fresco, where she opens the 9th
door for the first time and finds a _sitting room_. But we won't
rest there for now, instead we follow her up the _broken stars_ and into _Tumbrel_.

There she finds everything a apetalous young lady might need for a night out on the town.

> In the unfallen portion of the room, there was a
> triune mirror vanity and a dark wooden wardrobe taller than a tall woman
> standing on her toes. Auri peered shyly through the wardrobe’s half-open doors.
> She glimpsed a dozen dresses there, all **velvet** and embroidery. **Shoes**. A robe of
> silk. Some gauzy bits of the sort the women wore in the frescoes down in Wains.
> The vanity was a rakish thing: garrulous and unashamed. The top was scattered
> with pots of **powders, small brushes, sticks of eyepaint. Bracelets and rings.**
> Combs of **horn and ivory and wood**. There were pins and pens and a dozen bottles,
> some substantial, some delicate as petals. -- SROST:1:31:A1:D5:495:Tumbrel

Velvet is a soft, luxurious fabric that is characterized by a dense pile of
evenly cut fibers that have a smooth nap. You often see it used with rich dark
colors like burgundy.

Much later (but will mention it now) she will note the vanity also contains some gloves.

> She removed the pair of *gloves* from the right-hand
> drawer and set them near the mirror by a pot of *rouge*. 
>
> -- SROST:6:97:1531:A4:D8:Tumbrel

<img src="/img/bur-dress.jpg" height="350px" width="350px">

Such lovely items, feel the sly softness of the gloves. Imagine what they might
feel like against... Ahem.. sorry. Let's move on.

On her second day we followed her to Newarre. On the third day she _wept_ (we have all had those kinds of days) and we 
see here again on the fourth day, though she is still, if you will forgive the expression,  a _bit of mess_. She needs music, laughter
and fire. 

> She had been sitting like this, empty as eggshell. Hollow and chest-heavy in the
> angry dark when she’d first heard him playing. Back before he’d given her her
> sweet new perfect name. A piece of sun that never left her. It was a bite of
> bread. A flower in her heart. Thinking of this made it easier for her to stand.
> 
> -- SROST:5:80:1246

But her gift isn't ready. Not proper at all. 

> Three days. He would come visiting in three short
> days. And for all her work and wander, she hadn’t found a proper present for him
> yet. For all that she was wise about the way of things, she hadn’t caught an

> -- SROST:5:81:1257

Auri has so little time and she is so little herself. She is so hollow and empty and
upset with all of everything. Without music or love, with darkness as your only
neighbor what else can any of us turn to? She eats of course, what were you expecting?

She heads to Tree, which has more tools then treats, more the pity. She eats a turnip
and her last fit. She is visited by the smell of nutmeg, which seems reasonable, there are nutmeg pittems
in the room.

> Then she sat
> down on the floor and ate the turnip in small bites. Then she ate her last
> remaining fig. Her tiny face was grave. The smell of _nutmeg_ prickled in the air.
>
> -- SROST:6:5:1283:A4:D8:Tree:1285


We have reached a turning point. From here things start to blur, gold into
black. Forming a haze, a _hole_, wanting for all the world to feel the
safety of strong hands, the caress of soft skin and the promise of a bright
morning. But darkness comes before the light, and cannot mend what we do not understand. 

_onward we go then._

Kvothe, on the _same day_, at Ankers, can relate to the sudden smell of nutmeg in the air.

> I could suddenly smell nutmeg and plum.

He is inadvertently iridescent, He will have
things to rights. It's Auri that's amiss and missing the notes the world is
playing for her.  It's admissions day for Kvothe, he will dazzle the masters
and shortly be off to see Auri. But she _needs_ more time. It simply won't do...

> For all that she was wise about the way of things, she hadn’t caught an

So a young lady does what she must, whiners fuss, but winers now the way of things, 
some times you have to crush a few grapes to turn things to sweet...

Auri washed her face her hand her feet. She put on her new unashmed embroidered
burgundy dress and matching glove. Combed golden hair with Ivory and wood and
wood. She dusted her self delicately with powers, just enough color to give
herself a healthy look, well, maybe a bit more then healthy, she has a heartbeat
and who can blame a girl. She touched her eyebrows delicately with brushes,
though out of practice, it's like riding a horse... she picked lovely dark eye
paint full of midnight star gazing and secret glances. Finally she dawned her
brackets and rings and one more thing.... will cover later.

She went from beneath the Underthing up on top of things, all a glamoured,
adorned and asweat. Auri cheated time and fate, seeing him early and giving
herself wiggle room to find his gifts... She regrets it,
oh the improper nature of the world forces her to be wicked at times. Her eyes
are red and she is ridged. She has cried like a turned spigot and Auri knows all
about pipes and turnings. Knows all about the kinds of mess a spill can make.
She hates _hates_ the way it must be. She is wishes the cruel way of it would
_fall into the dark and die._

The conclusion here is heartbreaking and bitter. We want darkness to be an angry
bear, a restless beast and nameless face. But it's here, it's within us. It's
lost love, it's lonely nights, tangled thoughts, and desperate hopeless need. It's a mirror...

Auri isn't hateful or cruel... no, that's not true. She can be that, we all can. But
she is that and more. She is also beautiful and broken. She comes to Kvothe, she
knows all is not right...

> Then there came a small tapping at my window. A sound so tiny I didn’t notice it until it stopped.

She came in the night on either felling or her unnamed day, she brought him... a
stone of regret and the comfort of touch. Some of the motives are clear, the
means are within Auri's grasp, the time and locations are within reason. Though
we might not want to admit it, the story remains It does not go simply because
we wish to see it.

Were ragging and weary, but we must have a full accounting. To do that we must

u/drue801 titled her piece that touched on this [Why Auri?](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingkillerChronicle/comments/ez5qyi/auri_why/) 
The comments are largely depressing
I know why and now you start to see the edges of it. 

It is the first note of the song that burns in me.
