# Trees and Truths

_Do fall dayward?_

_Or dance wayward?_

_Or do all roads lead to fire?_

This section is slightly more whimsical, because I am less sure. 
Though be clear we should look for things:


* ivy 
* graveyard / boneyard
* monument w/ ivy
* laurel tree
* roots among the stone
* warm scent
* lonely

In some _form_ as they appear in the graveyard

## Iron fence

No obvious Iron fence in either place. A full discussion about Iron
can't fit here, because i haven't made up my mind on it. Let's 
say at best we might view. 

## Ivy

Our grave stone has Ivy:

> A small, forgotten graveyard, stones overgrown with ivy.

_one for loving_

> Felurian taught me ivy on the oak.

_one for hating_

> she already had hold of my wrist, and soon had my arm tangled firmly in Ivy on the Oak. 

_both for climbing_

> There were climbing vines...

These are both related to an oak however.

## Roses

Here we might be looking simply for Red. In which case we have butterflies

> “The red ones offend my aesthetic,”

And obviously Mercenaries

## Graves

_one for hating_

> The ground below was not a resting place for butterflies . . . it was strewn with lifeless wings. 

_one for fighting_

> Shehyn and i returned to the complex of stone buildings

> she entered the low stone building

> At first glance, Haert seemed to be this sort of town. It was little more than tiny homes, broken stone, and the occasional penned goat.

ok, so why are the Haert's stone homes like gravestones? Well, they aren't when
kvothe visits the first time. I suspect they _will be_ when he leaves the second time.

One word for now. *Cinder*

## Monument

There is no monument mentioned explicity near either Tree. I only 
have questions about the Adem's _wall_

> pieced together like a jigsaw. Looking closer, I was puzzled by the lack of

## Lonely Thing

The Cthaeh is hateful, but that's likely in part _because_ it is Lonely. 

> And as I ran I could hear Cthaeh speaking behind me. Its dry, quiet voice followed me longer than I would have thought possible. “Come back. Come back. I’ve more to say. I’ve so much more to tell you, won’t you stay?”

It's a vicious cycle. It knows everyone will leave it. The Latantha seem's to have lots of friends to dance with. 


## Laurel Tree & Fruit

lets look at the laurel "tree". It's actually hard to pin down anything without the specific Latin species name. 
It seem's

<img src="/img/gravetree.jpg" height="500px" width="400px">

Given the fruit is "dark blue"

>  Next she carried in the jar of dark blue laurel fruit

I believe the Laurel to be similar to an English Laurel/Cherry Laurel or maybe Fruit:

<img src="/img/english-laurel-fruit.jpeg" height="250px" width="250px">


This is a problem though, because as you can see from this picture, the wild english Laurel looks nothing like it:

<img src="/img/english-laurel.jpeg" height="250px" width="250px">

I think it's fair to say that neither the Sword Tree or the Cthaeh's tree
_looks_ like a Cherry Laurel tree. But chime in if you see something i don't.
Which is leaving me in a tight spot. Did Rothfuss not check the picture? I doubt it. A tree being a metaphor for
another tree is really odd. Maybe Auri is confused?  I mean, argue 
she wouldn't screw up the bone earlier because she attended the university, so now i'm in a bit of a tight spot.
But maybe the pine cones she picks up are from the tree? 

> Auri found the place while picking pine cones

Maybe the fruit is from the Ivy? Does any Ivy have fruit?

Well, Hedera *Helix* or Common Ivy  has a dark blue fruit:

<img src="/img/Hedera_helix1.jpeg" height="300px" width="300px">

Helix, if you didn't notice from my bold bolding. Is very close to Haliax. Which,
if that's somehow serving as a metaphor for Helix, would be hypocrisy at its best given

> “No,” said Lanre. He stood to his full height, his face regal behind the lines
> of grief. “There is nothing sweet. I will sow salt, lest the bitter weeds
> grow.”

Though, i must mention "a weed" is any plant "you" choose. This would mean our tree is what? A Pine Tree? Is now a good time
to speculate on why Auri and Elodin both want pinecones (even in jest)?

Finally, Threpe brings up Laurels in a way that suggests Kvothe is the Laurel fruit:

> He shrugged. “You see, a laurel needs rain to grow. I can’t do much about that. But I can keep that rain off a few musician’s heads, can’t I?” A sly smile wound its way onto his face. “So God will tend the laurels and keep them wet. And I will tend the players and keep them dry. And wiser minds than mine will decide when to bring the two together.”

## Lanre

If Savien is Lanre. Then there is a kvothe thinks Savien is like an oak

>And we sang! Her voice like burning silver, my voice an echoing answer. Savien sang solid, powerful lines, like branches of a rock-old oak, all the while Aloine was like a nightingale, moving in darting circles around the proud limbs of it.

Which Makes Aloine the Nightingale in "Swineherd and the Nightingale".

## Latantha

The "Sword Tree" would fit Lanre, given he was known for his strength of Arm. And his sword never left his side.


### Conclusions

I won't bother scoring, between The Sword Tree and The Cthaeh's Tree. I feel it's
fairly even. In the end they could all be the same tree or the graveyard could 
be something we haven't seen. Let me know what you find.
