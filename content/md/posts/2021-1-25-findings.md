_What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow_
<br>
_Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,_
<br>
_You cannot say, or guess, for you know only_
<br>
_A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,_
<br>
_And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,_
<br>
_And the dry stone no sound of water. Only_
<br>
_There is shadow under this red rock,_
<br>
_(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),_
<br>
_And I will show you something different from either_
<br>
_Your shadow at morning striding behind you_
<br>
_Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;_
<br>
_I will show you fear in a handful of dust._


_-- From The Waste Land by T.S Eliot_

##  A hand reaching

This story is part of a bigger one called [Warrens Widdershins Ways and
Woes](/post-outputs/2021-1-15-bone-and-crystal) which you should have read first
before this one. This will cover the Auri's journey to Wains, where she notices
something is amiss, and finds a amyr doll under the couch. Then will unwind the
journey from another perspective and you will not be happy with what I have to tell 
you. I suggest you go ahead and give fitting the pieces together yourself before reading my take. 

See the SROST chapter "The Far Below Bottom of things", to follow along, which you probably should do.

Lets join Auri on her magical trip into the Underthing 

<img src="/img/auri-underthing.jpeg " height="600px" width="450px">

where she visits Wains, discovers a new room, and notices something isn't quite proper. 

Lets let her describe Wains. SROST:1:35

> Auri brushed off her hands, swung the door
> open, and stepped lightly into Wains. The hallway was wide enough to drive a
> wagon through. High-ceilinged and long enough that Foxen’s light could barely
> reach the tangle of debris that blocked the far end. Above her, bluewhite light
> scattered off a crystal chandelier. Dark wood paneling hugged the lower portion
> of the walls, but above that was ornate plasterwork. There were broad frescoes
> decorating the ceiling. Women in gauze lounged about, whispering and rubbing oil on each other. Men
> frolicked about in the water, flapping around ridiculously in their absolute
> altogether. 

So note the bluewhite light, a chandelier, dark wood, a picture of women and men frolicking. 
She finds the Crystal here, but lets skip over that for now.

She decides to open the 9th door in Wains. She calls this new place a sitting
room, it has a velvet chair, a low wooden table, etc..

>  A tall velvet chair. A low wooden table. A plush couch on a plush carpet. In
> the corner was a tiny cart filled with glasses and bottles. They were very
> dignified. 

Note the velvet chair. Also she tells us something is wrong:

> There was something wrong with the room.

She looks around, she mentions the carpet in the room is like moss:

> plush of the carpet was sweet beneath her feet, like moss, 

She sees a tiny whiteness under the couch:

> and when she bent down to run her fingers over the hush of it, she glimpsed a tiny whiteness
> underneath the couch.

She reaches for it:

> She reached deep into the shadows with a small white hand,
> having to stretch a bit before her fingers caught it. Smooth and cool. It was a tiny figurine carved
> from a piece of pale, retiring stone. A small soldier with clever lines to show
> his hauberk and his shield.

Its they Amyr that was featured in Warrens Post. But it wasn't the issue with the room

> It didn’t belong here, but it wasn’t wrong. Or
> rather, it wasn’t what was wrong with the room. The poor thing was simply lost.
> Auri smiled and put the doll in her pocket with the crystal. It was then she
> felt a tiny bump beneath one foot. 

She takes a long look at a bone button, I suppose to see if its whats wrong, but
she doesn't think it is:

> She pulled up the edge of the carpet, rolled
> it back, and found a small bone button underneath. Auri eyed it for a long
> moment before giving it an understanding smile. That wasn’t it either. The
> button was just as it should

That's it! But will take another look to be sure. 

This is the turn around point, the cliff. You step into the darkness and your
falling... the air rolls over you, pulling at your flesh, you see nothing below
you, but you feel the weight of the sky bearing down on you. Do you spread your
hands to catch the wind or do you press them together and cut it like a knife?

## As Below so Above: A shadow reaching

Were going to back over the same path with just took with Auri. Only now instead of looking will be _seeing_.
When Auri enters Wains, were presented with a Fresco painting on the ceiling. 

> There were broad frescoes decorating the ceiling.

A fresco is a technique of mural painting, commonly used in cathedrals. You have
likely seen part of the "Creation of Adem" by Michelangelo, but take a look at
the full piece on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. It's worth a moment of our time here:

<img src="/img/chapelle.jpeg" height="500px" width="600px">

The one Auri sees women and men scantily clothed or naked lounging and frolicking:

<img src="/img/faerev.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" align="right">

> Women in gauze lounged about, whispering and rubbing oil on each other. Men
> frolicked about in the water, flapping around ridiculously in their absolute
> altogether.

This _is_ the fae. I'm not saying she is seeing painting of the Fae. I'm saying,
she is _seeing the Fae_. The dark wood paneling are trees, the men and women are
Fae and mortal guest unabashedly enjoying each others company.

Let me draw attention to some other aspects of "The sitting room" as Auri calls
it. It has a chandelier with bluewhite light scattered off a Crystal chandelier.

> Above her, bluewhite light scattered off a crystal chandelier. Dark wood paneling 

Much like the sky above our young hero Kvothe, miles, days and worlds away in the Fae. TMWF:100:

> I was reminded of a vast, empty cathedral swathed in sooty velvet.

The roof above Auri just as he describes it. 

<img src="/img/auricathedral.png" height="500px" width="300px">

The Chandelier's bluewhite light, reflected on his eyes:

> ...the last hint of purple was gone, leaving the sky a perfect velvet black, flecked with unfamiliar stars.

The carpet moss beneath Auri's toes:

> plush of the carpet was sweet beneath her feet, like moss,

it's pleasant touch one Felurian knows:

> So I followed, naked and unprepared. Felurian struck out at a good pace, the moss muffling the
> sound of our bare feet.

Now, like Kvothe we travel naked and unprepared, and with some trepidation, for
on the edges of our memory we know what comes next. It reaches from the dark
corners of our mind, the air is drawn tight in our throats...

<img src="/img/darkforest.jpg" height="600px" width="400px">

Kvothe knows neither the names of the stars, or the secrets they hold. He sees
the surface and cant fathom the depths bellow, and so he makes a foolish show:

> Thinking myself clever, I made a sympathetic binding for light and held my hand
> above my head as if it were a torch. I was more than slightly proud of this, as the motion-to-light
> binding is rather difficult without a piece of metal to use as a focus.
> Light swelled and I caught a moment’s glimpse of our surroundings. Dark trunks of trees rose like
> massive pillars as far as the eye could see. There were no low-hanging branches, no undergrowth, no
> grass. Only dark moss underfoot and the arch of dark branches overhead. I was reminded of a vast,
> empty cathedral swathed in sooty velvet.

Felurian heard the deep tremble and so she makes a hasty gamble, two hearts beat as one...

> “ciar nalias!” Felurian snapped.

> An instant later Felurian leapt at me and bore me to the ground, her lithe, naked body pressed against mine.

now something wicked this way comes...

> There was a soft sound of movement above us, as if someone was folding a huge piece of velvet
> around a piece of broken glass. Saying that I realize it makes no sense, but still, that is the best way I
> can describe the sound. It was a soft noise, the half-heard sound of deliberate movement. I cannot tell
> you why it made me think of something terrible and sharp, but it did. My forehead prickled with
> sweat, and I was filled with a sudden pure and breathless terror.

For though the stars seem tiny from afar...

> and when she bent down to run her fingers over the hush of it, she glimpsed a tiny whiteness
> underneath the couch.

they too can scar...

> She was full of broken glass and burrs. She was weary and disappointed with all of everything.

And you would not want to meet them as they truly are...

> She reached deep into the shadows with a small white hand,
> having to stretch a bit before her fingers caught it. 

so stay small as selas, still as stone...

> She pulled up the edge of the carpet, rolled
> it back, and found a small bone button underneath. Auri eyed it for a long
> moment before giving it an understanding smile. That wasn’t it either. The
> button was just as it should

And pray they leave you alone.

## Epilogue

The implications of this are terrible to behold, I'll leave you to your own
thoughts. Take a moment, go outside, make plans for dinner, maybe white wine,
garlic, fresh pasta and a bit of parsley.

Next will sit down and consider the hidden [turnings](/posts-output/2021-1-26-turnings) of the world...
