## Intro: The Arborist's hemp

This post is a continuation of [shadows on the Wal.](/posts-output/2021-2-15-finding). This story is intended to be read from the start,
which is [Warren Widdershins Ways and
Woes](/posts-output/2021-1-15-bone-and-crystal). As such, we will quickly continue on.
Similar to before will cover Auri's journey as she sees it. Then will walk it
back and I'll show you what I see. This is broken into several parts. I
feel broken into pieces, too; I hear a sharp ringing and try to pull myself
together. The world seems to swirl around and finally slows and coalesces into
something reasonable. Blue, bottles. A low wooden table.and I catch my breath. We are back in
Auri's sitting room. Something real, something we can touch. I put my hand upon
the tall velvet chair. It feels normal, like sunlight and rugged, honest wood
beneath. Auri insists something is still _wrong_ with the place. On top of that,
she can't find a proper place for Fulcrum. Which is sad, all things deserve
their place. Oh, I'm sorry I haven't introduced you to fulcrum. I'm terrible
sorry, how very rude of me.

Will need to focus our Alar and follow several paths at once. It seems unfair, us 
recently all put back together, but time is against us, he is coming...

## 1st Binding: A hard heavy weight of answers

Fulcrum didn't always go by that name. Auri gave it when... wait. What I doing?
A _proper_ story starts at the beginning. So let's have a proper telling. On the
first day, Auri found it in the deep dark below of the Twelve. It would also be
fair to the Underthing as a whole if we explored it a bit more as well, it's
slow going, but worth doing.

<!-- 228 -->

A heavy burden indeed, enough to jostle her about and let foxen slip...

<!-- 254 -->


<img src="/img/auri-water-foxen.png" height="600px" width="350px">

But duty is formost in Auri's heart, and to lose the gear is unimaginable.

> Losing Foxen was bad. It would leave her blind and lonely in

> too. But neither of those things were wrong. Letting the metal slide into the
> dark simply could not be done. It was unthinkable.  --18
<!-- 284 -->

and so she does it! _Nearly_ drowned, but full of joy:

> Auri heaved the thing out of the water, and it struck the stone floor with the
> sound of a bell. It was a bright brass gear, big as a platter. Thicker than her
> thumb with some to spare. It had a hole in the middle, nine teeth, and a jagged
> gap where a tenth had long ago been torn away. It was full of true answers and
> love and hearthlight. It was beautiful. Auri smiled and heaved up half a
> stomachful of water on the stones. Then heaved again, turning her head so that
> it didn’t splash against the bright brass gear. She coughed then, took a
> mouthful of water, and spat it back into the pool. The brass gear lay heavy as a
> heart on the cold stones of The Yellow Twelve. The light from up above made the
> surface of it shimmerant and gold. It looked like a piece of sun she’d brought
> up from the deep. Auri coughed again and shivered. Then she reached out and
> touched it with one finger. She smiled to look at it. Her lips were blue. She
> trembled. Her heart was full of joy. --19
<!-- 298 -->

Auri is kind and the world is kind in turn, and so foxen from it's depths is returned:

> But the thought of
> leaving Foxen in the dark was enough to put a fine, thin crack straight through
> her heart. To lose him after all this time.... Then Auri caught a glimpse of
> something deep below the surface. A glint. A glow. She grinned. Foxen looked for

> way slowly up through all the tangled pipes. She waited five long minutes,
> watching Foxen’s bottle bob and drift until it finally popped up to the surface
> like a duck. Then she caught it up and kissed it. She held it to her chest. Oh
> yes. It was well worth it, doing things the proper way. --20
<!-- 310 -->

She carries the gear, along with her other gifts back to port:

> The great brass gear was bright straight through. The key was black as black. --23
<!-- 324 -->

The gear would _almost_ make a gift for him.

> The gear would
> need consideration. It almost felt like it could be for him—but that could wait. --23
<!-- 351 -->

But, it wasn't right yet and whats worse she can't seem to find the right place for it!

> The gear
> was troublesome in this regard. She set it on the bookshelf, then moved it to
> the table in the corner. It leaned against the wall, the gap from its lost tooth
> pointing up into the air. Auri frowned. It wasn’t quite the proper place. Auri
> brought out the key and held it in front of the gear. Black and brass. Both for
> turning. They had twelve teeth between them.... She shook her head and sighed.
> She put the key back into her pocket and left the great brass gear on the
> bookshelf. It wasn’t the proper place for it, but it was the best that she could
> do for now. -- 24
<!-- 362 -->

She sees if the crystal will put it to rights, she even tries resting it in Mantle, but it seems most content vexing her.
She leaves it there to sulk. Then resorts to flattery by placing it atop the mantelpiece beside her box of stone. What could possibly resist.... but no, not a peep from it. Auri is nearly angry with everything, but no, she knows it's her fault for not knowing its proper place. Maybe it doesn't want to be with her at all? A sad thought, but it may be the way of things, and that's the way things have to go. So she takes it back to the Twelve. She places it by the edge of the pool and gives it a moment to consider. To her delight, it doesn't want to go. She weighs some other locations, but nothing feels right. She rushes to see what's wrong with Tenance and sees to fixing a leaky pipe, the whole business is quite distressing, and she heads back to Mantle to calm down. After setting yourself to rights, she gathers up the brazen gear. She carries it on to Wains, maybe it belonged there, or perhaps it could help her find out what was wrong with the place. So she took it to her new sitting room and placed it upon the couch:

> Then into her new sitting room. She sat the brazen gear upon the couch
> and curled up close beside it, tucking her feet underneath herself. It wasn’t
> any more content. Auri sighed and cocked her head at it. Poor thing. To be so
> lovely and so lost. **To be all answerful with all that knowing trapped inside. To
> be beautiful and broken.** -- 59
<!-- 965 -->

Though she can't see to help the Fulcrum, it finds the strength to help her. As she runs her hands along its broken tooth it shows her what's amiss in the room. The bone button needs companionship. 


> Auri set the tarnished buckle

> tiny bird come tumbling out to fly around the room. She stood in the center of
> the room and spun in a circle to see it all. -- 60
<!-- 980 -->

Things more set to right, she gathers the gear and heads back to mantle where
set puts it above the fireplace, where it seems sullen again. Maybe the sitting
room _was_ better? Auri has other things to be about. But she finds herself all
turned untrue inside when she finds her blanket twisted in the corner. She tries
to see if the gear will help, the horrid galling stubborn thing, might it lend a
hand? But no, of course not. She would like to blame things on the brazen turner,
but she knows it's not true. She wishes the world would run like a well-oiled
gear, but the oil seems to always run out. She is so chafed and chaffed inside,
rubbed raw and empty. She needs to sets herself to rights, but even she can't get clean,
because something has taken her perfect soap!


> All flickerling and sticky with web, Auri made her way to Bakery. It wasn’t

> This was Bakery. This was

> Underneath the scent of her sweet cinnas soap was the smell of **musk** and piss.

<!-- 1287-1321 -->

Auri settles for a less satisfying bath in Mantle. But her rest is short, as she hears
a cry for help. 

> And echoes came from everywhere,
> scattered by the pipes and water in The Silver Twelve, so ears were hardly any

<!-- 1335-1355 -->

As so often is the case her, her kindness goes unrewarded. What's more something has also put her perfect
place into disarray. Her blanket all twisted and turned, it's enough to make her nearly cry.

> she might cry, but when she felt around inside herself she found she had no
> crying left. She was full of broken glass and burrs. She was weary and
> disappointed with all of everything. --89

She tried everything to set it to rights, even seeing if her new _living_ room might have the answers...

> Auri carried the blanket all the way down to Wains and
> into her new perfect sitting room. She draped it over the **back of the couch**. She
> folded it and set it in the **chair**. Finally, in true desperation, Auri set her

<!-- 1413 -->

Later she tries to set herself to rights by making more of her perfect soap. You
can't clean the world if you're a mess, after all. All seems right as honey until she 
sees the pomace is full of red screaming.

> It was full of screaming. Days of endless dark red screaming. It had been hidden
> by the mysteries before, but now the selas-sweet had stolen those away, and Auri
> saw the screaming clear as day. --113
<!-- 1768 -->

She knew enough of red and screaming. It wouldn't do. She takes it to Boundry.
Which isn't her place any longer. The experience leaves her ragged. She can't
seem to fix anything, she wants some honey, but she knows she mustn't.... She
feels the panic start to rise.

> She felt the panic rising in her

> Even her most perfect place. Her bed was almost not her bed. Her perfect leaf so

> But when she moved a bit she saw it was not hard at all. It was downhill. The

> Clicked. Fit. Fixed. Trembling, she looked around and saw that everything was
> fine. Her bed was just her bed. All of everything in Mantle: fine. Nothing was

> 
> Auri sat down hard upon the floor. So sudden-full of sweet relief she gasped.
> She laughed and gathered up the gear and held it to her chest. She kissed it.
> She closed her eyes and wept. --115

<img src="/img/auri-fulcrum-hold.png" height="600px" width="350px">

So Fulcrum is her rock on a stormy night. It's pride a pedestal; it's shimmerant
a guiding light. As a reward, she takes Fulcrum to see Tree. It's the least she
could do for its help. She makes some pea soup. She is nearly out of food... but
she puts that out of her mind. After her soup, on the way back to Mantle, they
encounter some scattered leaves, a bit of a mystery, really. She discovers where
they came from and leaves her silver etched plate there. She checks on the
vanity in Tumbrel again and then finally takes a well-deserved rest in Annulet.

> She paused to rest in Annulet, her new and **perfect circle** of a sitting room.
> Fulcrum settled like a king upon the **velvet chair** while Auri lounged upon the
> fainting couch and let her arms recover from the oh sweet ache of holding him.
> But she was too busy for long lounging. --130
<!-- 2018: -->

There isn't much left to Fulcrums journey, but we can save the last bit for
later. Let's travel through the second door Auri finds in Annulet. She finds
some worrisome stairs, but nothing she can't navigate.

> A second door sat on the other side
> of the room, eager to be opened. She worked the latch, walked through a hallway,
> only to come to the foot of a set of stairs. There she looked around with some
> surprise. She’d thought that she was still in Wains. But clearly not. This was a
> different place entirely. Auri’s heart beat faster then. It had been ages since
> she’d come on somewhere wholly new. A place that dared to be entirely itself.
> Still, carefully. In Foxen’s steady light Auri looked closely at the walls and
> ceiling. --29
<!-- 452 -->

The ceiling above had collapsed.

> At the top of the stairs the ceiling had collapsed, but there was a gap made by
> a broken wall. Auri stepped through and found herself grinning with the thrill
> of it. Another new place. --30
<!-- 478 -->

> Half the ceiling had fallen in and everything was covered in dust. --31
<!-- 483 -->

In the room she finds a vanity mirror, a _proud_ place indeed.

> In the unfallen portion of the room, there was a
> **triune** mirror vanity and a dark wooden wardrobe taller than a tall woman
> standing on her toes. --31

It's a bit of a mess, but Auri is use to places being untidy.

> It was half-buried by a broken beam and blocks of **shattered stone**. --31

She finds a white tatted lace that goes nicely with her crystal and her ciridae.

> She found the wreckage of a small table underneath the stones, and amid
> the splintered wood she found a length of fine white tatted lace. She folded
> this up carefully and put it in her pocket with the **crystal** and the **small stone soldier**. --32

There is much more to Tumbrel, you doubtless recall this is where Auri found her
going out dress and face. No doubt a clever reader will be able to find much more, especially once
they learn the proper way of looking. But for now, lets move on...

## Interlude: A lever long enough

<img src="/img/fulcrum-arch.jpg" height="400px" width="500px">

We need to leave Auri and her fulcrum behind, will see them later where all roads meet. We
need to pick up another thread and that means a double binding. 

## 2nd Binding: Towards the dark of a grinning winters night.


We catch up with Kvothe and Felurian after their terrifying experience in the Fae. Kvothe wisely asks
no questions and together then continue their journey. The travel nightward, in search of darkness and a shaed.

> So we continued in darkness. Eventually my eyes adjusted, and through the branches above I could

> Then it became truly dark. Felurian was little more than a piece of pale darkness ahead of me. --TMMF this and below Chapter 100 shaed
<!-- 19145 -->

As they start to lose the light Felurian calls out more gently then a cat and is answered by hundreds of small
flickering moth lights.

> She

> were about to shout.
> I cringed at the thought of a loud noise invading the warm quiet of this place. But instead of a shout
> there was nothing. No. Not nothing. It was like a low, slow purr. Not anything so loud and rough as a
> **cat’s purr**. It was closer to the sound a heavy snowfall makes, a muffled hush that almost makes less
> noise than no noise at all. 
<!-- ~ felurian/kvothe walk 19156 -->

> I could no longer see even the faintest shape of her.
> After the final pause, Felurian stepped close to me in the dark, pressing her body to mine. She gave

<!-- ~ k/f walk 19174 -->

They pass over soft soil, a farmers field, twisting stone path and then a high bridge.

> over the arch of a **high bridge**. All the while the moths followed us, giving me only the dimmest
> impression of our surroundings. 

<!-- ~ K/f walk 19182 -->


They find themselves in an open space, with vast darkness overhead. Kovthe feels the presence of 
something great sleeping there.

> sleeping, this place felt like it had stirred half a moment ago and hovered on the **verge of waking**. It
> was disconcerting. 
<!-- kvothe/felurian 19193 -->

Felurian finds what she needs at the _center of the fae_. Kvoth watches like a new born lamb as she picks 
_things_ from all around.

> Felurian gently pressed the flat of her hand against my chest, then a finger against my lips. I
> watched as she moved away from me, softly humming a little snatch of the song I had made for her.
> But even this piece of flattery couldn’t distract me from the fact that I was in the **center** of the Fae

> A handful of moths had landed on Felurian, resting on her wrist, hip, shoulder and thigh. Watching
> them gave me a vague impression of her movements. If I had to guess, I would have said she was
> picking things out of the trees, from behind or beneath bushes or stones. A **warm breeze** sighed
> through the clearing, and I felt strangely comforted as it brushed my bare skin.
> After about ten minutes, Felurian came back and kissed me. She held something soft and warm in
> her arms. 
<!-- ~ kf 19202 TWMF -->

They head back until they reach a cleaning. Felurian stops kvothe from looking past the curtain and then he watches
patiently as she weaves starlight into his newborn shaed.

<!-- ~ Kvoteh/felurian walk 19027 twmf -->

Later kvothe tries to learn about fae magic but his efforts are fruitless.

> Felurian’s magic. Most of her answers continued to be hopelessly matter-of-fact. How do you take

> apparently.

The pass the time pleasantly until Felurian sense the shaed is ready. Knowing kvothe will be nothing but a nuisance
she sends him away:

> Felurian said nothing. She held it tightly between her **thumb and two forefingers**, as if it were a
> snake struggling to twist around and **bite her**. Her mouth made a thin line, and her eyes began to
> brighten from their customary twilight purple to a deep-water blue.
> “Can I help?” I asked.
> She laughed. Not the light, chiming laugh I had heard so often, but a wild, fierce laugh. “do you
> want to help truly?” she asked. The hand holding the shard of iron trembled slightly.
> I nodded, a little frightened.
> “then go.” Her eyes were still changing, brightening to a **bluish-white**.

The Shaed is no simple magic, much of the world will revolve around the events of its creation.
But we can only focus on a few parts at a time, and so, like Kvothe we must go looking else where for a bit...

## Interlude: From Dust To Dawn

To quickly reccap, Felurian leads Kvothe from twilight into night and back. Along the way back they stop a curtain and she pulls light to weave into the his new shaed. Later we get a sense of how time and space works in the fae. Which is to say, nothing like they do in the mortal realm. 

> I also learned that there aren’t directions of the usual sort in the Fae. Your trifoil compass is useless

> the sun rise in the east.
>
> But if you look closely at the sky, one piece of the horizon will be a shade brighter, in the opposite
> direction a shade darker. If you walk toward the brighter horizon, eventually it will become daytime.
> The other way leads to darker night. If you keep walking in one direction long enough, you will
> eventually see a whole “day” pass and end up in the **same place you began**. That’s the theory, at any
> rate.
>
> Felurian described those two points of the Fae compass as Day and Night. The other two points she
> referred to at different times as Dark and Light, **Summer and Winter**, or Forward and Backward. Once
> she even referred to them as Grimward and Grinning, but something about the way she said it made
> me suspect it was a joke.

So you move _towards_ time. E.g you can walk towards dayward, as we see Kvothe do. 
Does that mean the less you move the less time passes? Trees must be very old indeed then.
If I had to summarize, I would say that in the real world time and space are linked and expanding.
In the Fae you can walk a whole day and return back to where you started. The natural right
shape might be one perfect circle. But things dont feel right to me, they feel twisted against themselves.

Sim told us that we know nothing about Alchemy and Kote reminded us Fae
are as different from us as oil is to water. I'm reminded of Auri, who is both, and how
little we understand the shifting lights of the depths below, like twilight playing off a gem

<img src="/img/gemstone.jpg" height="400px" width="400px">

we see the flicking lights and think our musing a fancy. We see the shadows they
cast and think our thoughts a trickster. For in their edges we cannot breath, we
feel the darkness horrible need. Fear kills the mind, and we must face the
shadows. And so first high above we must go. And that means another binding. We
can hardly hold the shape of ourselves together, we hear our own voice through walls of stone
arguing, shouting to be let out, planning against us. But the plan, the vision, the road we 
must hold the course...

## 3rd Binding: From bridges to lights below

We see our past, our friends, the velvet sky all terrifying and beautiful above.

> The night is like **warm velvet** around them. The stars, **burning diamonds**
> in the cloudless sky, turn the road beneath their feet a silver grey. The
> University and Imre are the hearts of understanding and art, the strongest of
> the four corners of civilization. Here on the road between the two there is
> nothing but old trees and long grass bending to the wind. The night is perfect
> in a wild way, almost **terrifyingly beautiful**. --NOTW:374
<!-- Kvothe 10019 -->

We walk road that divides. Music and faeries on one side and sympathy and mastery on the other.

> The Eolian lay at the heart of Imre, its front doors facing out onto the city’s
> central cobblestone courtyard. There were benches, a few flowering trees, and a
> **marble fountain misting water over a statue of a satyr chasing a group of
> half-clothed nymphs whose attempt at flight seemed token at best.** Well-dressed
> people milled around, nearly a third carrying some sort of musical instrument or
> another. I counted at least seven lutes. --NOTW:374

We follow the road over the a high bridge and to an immense greystone and enter. We taste lemons and
though true, they are sour.

> My mouth tasted strangely of **lemons.** --NOTW:302

Past the smell of leather and forgotten secrets.

> The air was cool and dry. It smelled of old **leather**, parchment, and **forgotten secrets**. --NOWT:303

riding the rivers current downward.

> as he turned to descend a long flight of stone steps. Centuries of use had
> worn down the stone, making the stairs look as bowed as heavy-laden shelves. As we started down,
> the shadows made the steps look smooth and dark and edgeless, like an abandoned **riverbed** worn
> from the rock. --TWMF:295

Towards the center, _seeing_, dark cloth and flicking **candlelight** behind it.

> Once, twice, then the door swung
> open and we were confronted with a looming figure in a dark robe. His cowled hood shadowed his
> face, and the long sleeves of his robe stirred in the wind. --TWMF:296

## Interlude: Striking the stem

We have traveled around a bit with Fulcrum. He has been brazen, proud, sullen,
vexing, stubborn, and answerful. He came from below, and he helped Auri in a
tight spot. He is a symbol of motion, movement, and turnings. But he is also
beautiful and broken. We have walked with Kvothe and felurian and she has woven
him a shaed. We have hovered above our friends and dived deep below the Archives
for secrets. To what end? What does it have to do with the price of butter?

Three bindings we have made, and three times now, we have reached a turning
point. Three times is the proper way, what the world will bear. All the stories
agree on this: three gifts, three calls, three parts of silence. But we, like
Auri, are not always proper. And so a final turn, hidden from the slight of men.
A desperate gentle thing, just breath to set it into motion. So soft and pure
creation itself bends, and bends and bends ... bends... and breaks. There is no
thunderclap, no distant drums. The stars hang silently in the sky—only a slight
change in the wind, a hesitation, then slight pull upward. As if the world hung
by a string, now cut, and is falling.

## 4th binding: Called forth from beyond

We split again and our mind starts to reel, we see only flashes. We can't
control them, they press in from all sides. We are a leaf in the wind... but
this is a storm, and we are wet and battered against the branches of a tall dark
tree.

Were filled with the smell of felurian, we her gentle purr and she is all spice, musk..

> Her breath in my mouth, filling my head. The hot tips of her breasts brush my
> chest. The smell of her like **clover, like musk,** like ripe apples fallen to the ground ... --TWMF:633

She the perfect sculpture of beauty...

> Felurian lay, her naked body loosely splayed in sleep.
> She looked smooth and perfect as a **sculpture.** --TWMF:634

Her claws tear at dark velvet...

> She smiled like a knife in velvet and stretched like a **cat** in the sun --TWMF:636

Were pushed forward in time, to a quiet inn and the harmless chatter of farmers...

> The smith’s prentice set his glass down only to have it tip onto its side and roll across the bar. He
> snatched it up before it skittered over the edge and turned it over, eyeing its rounded bottom
> suspiciously.
> Jake laughed a loud farmer ’s laugh at his bewilderment while Carter made a point of setting his
> glass on the bar topside-down. “I don’t know how they do it in Rannish,” Carter said to the boy. “But
> round here there’s a reason we call it a **tumble**.”  --TMWF:140

_We are stretched too thin, and breaking._ Skarpi's words start to give us wings we
need to fly. He speaks of the a lost place from long ago. 

> Once, years and miles away, there was Myr Tariniel. The shining city. It sat
> among the tall mountains of the world like a **gem on the crown of a king**. Imagine
> a city as large as Tarbean, but on every corner of every street there was a
> bright **fountain**, or a green tree growing, or a **statue so beautiful it would make
> a proud man cry to look at it**. The buildings were tall and graceful, carved from
> the **mountain ** itself, carved of a **bright white stone** that held the **sun’s light
> long after evening fell.** --NOTW:183

and of it's ruler of the seeing eye

> Selitos was well loved by the people he protected. His judgments were strict
> and fair, and none could sway him through falsehood or dissembling. Such was
> the power of his sight that he could read the hearts of men like
> **heavy-lettered books.** --NOWT:695

and a tale of it's fall

> Together they walked the **mountain paths**. Lanre leading the way, they came to a
> **high place** in the mountains where they could look out over the land. The **proud**
> towers of Myr Tariniel shone brightly in the last light of the setting sun. --NOTW:186

Which lead to the blackening of the sky and of a face.

> Selitos spoke the long name that lay in Lanre’s heart, and at the sound of it
> the sun grew dark and **wind tore stones from the mountainside**.
>
> Then Selitos spoke, “This is my doom upon you. May your face be always held in
> shadow, **black as the toppled towers** of my beloved Myr Tariniel. “This is
> my doom upon you. Your own name will be turned against you, that you shall
> have no peace. “This is my doom upon you and all who follow you. May it last
> until the world ends and the Aleu fall nameless from the sky” Selitos watched
> as a darkness gathered about Lanre. Soon nothing could be seen of his handsome
> features, only a vague impression of nose and mouth and eyes. All the rest was
> shadow, black and seamless. Then Selitos stood and said, “You have beaten me
> once through guile, but never again. Now I see truer than before and my power
> is upon me. I cannot kill you, but I can send you from this place. Begone! The
> sight of you is all the fouler, knowing that you once were fair.” But even as
> he spoke them, the words were bitter in his mouth. Lanre, his face in shadow
> darker than a starless night, was blown away like smoke upon the wind. Then
> Selitos bowed his head and wept hot tears of blood upon the earth. --NOTW:190

The past pours into us like a torrent. We are drowning in it. We are full to
bursting with all this knowing. We are a white river in full fury and we must
focus if we hope to live. No, we are kneeling hopeless by the rivers edge. In our hands
sharp glass pressed to skin. Another binding? But were already too cold. Our vision is glossy as lights
shift back and forth in the dark. We see woman wearing blue silk on the far
bank. Her face turned away from us. Her too pale body seems ridge and still,
with only her purple grey wrist given motion by the stream...

_from something we pull the omethi_

_and find nearly a song_

_we push moteth from something_

_and find that we can sing once more_

We are filled with light. It bursts from our mouth our eyes. Our hand held the
flame, but the &#x2612; forgets, once a fire is started, the wind decides which
way it goes... <b>&#x21af;</b>



And so we shine like a light in the dark, we are near a greystone once more. Willem and Simmon
aren't there to entertain, to show the way or lend sympathy. We
must walk this road alone, following not their footfalls, but the delicate
trace of felurian from the **moss** of the fae, through the greystone, then a
soft **soil**, upon a **farmer ’s fresh-tilled field** and following a
**twisting path of smooth paved stone** that leads over the **high arch of
Stonebridge** that leads to _something something el_...

To follow this path path we must leave walls and rules behind. 
We must be able to hold onto the belief that a thing is more the story
and less the conceptions we have of it. We have broken our minds, and hold
each tale in a room. Now we must tip our minds in to spinning leaf, and walk through the walls...

-----

Now we travel to deep dark below. Quickly as sun is faded, see flickering light
from far away amusing. Before us fair felurian, full chest rising. Her soft
footfalls imre's cobblestone finding. The arch of her step no cold statue, her
beauty fast brings pride weeping. Her too clever cat eyes seeing, the shadows
heart is gone seeking. So to shaeding her flame, her road leads under us under
things, to bakery, where warm breeze incubates. A niche, a nest, where hatchling
dreams of flight await. See her plucking summer and winter out of time, stealing
this fruit from the fluter. Her gentle musk, a tuft of hair, the only traces of the feline looter.
But to take alone, is little avail, so they must seek the veil. It's a mystery, why they call it the fishery,
something we must leave for another day. For now it's enough to say, its from lamp light she weaves:

<img src="/img/kilvin-card.webp" height="400px" width="250px">

<img src="/img/metal-lasts.jpg" height="400px" width="250px">

I worry their smoke the wings upon which this tragedy rides. Or could the light
be past lemon, leather and descending river stone, behind the puppet strings, a
curtain into candlelight? Last, I dare suggest, it might simply come warm velvet
night. The stars, burning diamonds in a cloudless sky. Though that would imply,
all the world caught within it's eye.

Lets leave that door closed for now and our join our lady of the quiet.
Her blue-white eyes joined to darker self. See how she grips on burning iron with thumb and forefinger,
and feels the bite of tiny teeth. But our young hero is not there to see, how a shaed truley came to be.

for he was sent away... 

<img src="/img/sunsetpurple.jpeg" height="400px" width="400px">

Recall Auri's "Sitting Room" is part of the Fea. It has two
pieces of furniture you can sit on: a couch and a velvet chair. It
Auri's hand that reached under the couch to find the light. That implies some
separation between things under the couch and things near the velvet chair.

It means a border, moving from darkness to the lights of the chandelier above.
We are brave, young, and far from home and hearth. Our eyes, like our red haired
heroes, used to twilight's haze, adjust to daylight...

> Still, I knew I wouldn’t be welcome back in the clearing for some time. So I
> pointed my face Dayward and set off to explore. I can’t say why I wandered so

>

> Still I continued, enjoying the feel of **sunlight on my skin after so long in

>
> The trail I followed seemed to be leading to a lone tree standing in the
> grassy field. I decided I would go as far as that tree, then head back. -- TWMF:104:680

A tree, with power-blue blossoms.

> It was no type of tree I had ever seen before, and I approached it slowly. It resembled a vast

> with pale, **powder-blue** blossoms.

At its feet a glittering gemstone graveyard:

> littered the grass beneath the tree’s canopy, like a blanket of **gemstones.**

Kvothe sees a blue topped tree, Auri see's a blue chair, but the voice from the _crown_ tells us it is neither:

> I am no tree. No more than is a man a chair.

Not a chair, but a thrown.

> Fulcrum settled like a king upon the velvet chair

_See a tree tall as mountain grown, its trunk sunlit warmth known_

_climb it naked and alone_

_seek us now the lord of stone_

_the stories not legends but prophecy_

_here thrice and attend to me_

_not a tree, but a great king_

<img src="/img/tree-of-gondor-bc-why-not.webp" height="550px" width="330px">


_the joy his tales bring a delight for simple townsfolk_

_see his cloak of no particular color..._

_see now a grim graveyard gem,_

_let your eyes linger, a ring on upon each finger._

_except that which was cut away_

_upon his head a crown_

_from there did the silent lady weave her shaed_

_and beyond diamond curtains veil, the price was paid_


<img src="/img/cattree.png" height="500px" width="900px">


## Epilogue

What? A great question. I know so many whats... What's the reason she calls it
Tumbrel? What is Kilvin really fishing for? What do you call an upside broken
mirror?

_an awry Faeriniel_

Gods twisted hooter, What ever else you might forget, remember that. I promise, you
will laugh when the time comes. I guarantee it. 

You don't believe? Pity, but I guess that's what happens when we think were on
top of everything, _in control_. Flying high without a care in the sky. The air
is clean and the sky is blue. How exhilarating! How romantic... But the dross, the rot, it's
building... _oh yes, I taste it_. The pipes are close to breaking, and she is so tired and
broken. and you know what she thinks before she hurts herself? You.

But your busy riding the wind, I understand. I suppose that's the price
you pay for wings, eventually you fall.
