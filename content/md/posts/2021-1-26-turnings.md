“I want a faerie story!”

"... There and back again! ..."

"The Dragon and Wheel!"

"The Princess and mr. Whi..."

This post is a continuation of [Shadows on the
wal](/posts-output/2021-1-25-findings). No that's not a typo. As what follows
won't really click without the necessary context. As such will continue quickly
ahead. Most of the content will be covering is from SROST "Beautiful and
Broken". Similar to before, will cover Auri's journey as she sees it. Then will
walk it back and I'll show you what I see. Broken into two parts, this gives me
a chance to first highlight something without imposing my beliefs on you. 

So, were back in Auri's sitting room, something is still wrong and on top of that she 
can't find a proper place for fulcrum. Sad face. She tries
curling up with the Fulcrum on the coach:

> She sat the brazen gear upon the couch and curled up close beside it, tucking
> her feet underneath herself. It wasn’t any more content.

poor lonely fulcrum. 

> To be all answerful with all that knowing trapped inside. To be beautiful and
> broken. Auri nodded and lay her hand gently on the gear’s smooth face consolingly.

Where at one point she takes a rest from carrying Fulcrum around, setting him on velvet
chair.

We know from our last post this is "Sitting Room" is part of the Fea. 
It has two things you can sit on a couch and a velvet chair. Recall that
Auri's hand, reached under the couch to find the bone button. That implies some
separation between things under the couch and things near the chair. 

It means a border, moving from darkness to the lights of the chandelier above. We are
brave, young and far from home and hearth. Our eyes, like our red haired hero, used to twilight's haze,
adjust to daylight... TWMF:104:

A tree, with power-blue blossoms.

Kvothe sees a blue topped tree, Auri see's a blue chair, but the voices tell us it's neither:

> I am no tree. No more than is a man a chair.

Not a chair, but a thrown, not a tree, but a brazen gear:
