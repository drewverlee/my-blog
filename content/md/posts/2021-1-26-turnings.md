This post is a continuation of [Shadows on the wal](/posts-output/2021-1-25-findings). As such, we will quickly continue on. Similar to before will cover Auri's journey as she sees it. Then will walk it back and I'll show you what I see. As such, this is broken into two parts. I feel broken into pieces, too; I hear a sharp ringing and try to pull myself together. The world seems to swirl around and finally slows and coalesces into something reasonable. Blue, bottles, and I catch my breath. We are back in Auri's sitting room. Something real, something we can touch. I put my hand upon the velvet chair. It feels normal, like sunlight and rugged, honesty wood beneath.
Auri insists something is still _wrong_ with the place. On top of that, she
can't find a proper place for Fulcrum. Which is sad, all things deserve their
place. Oh, I'm sorry I haven't introduced you to fulcrum. I'm terrible sorry, how very rude of me.

## A hard heavy weight of answers

Fulcrum didn't always go by that name. Auri gave it to it when ... what I doing? A _proper_ story starts at the beginning. 
So let's have a proper telling. On the first day, Auri found it in the deep dark below of the Twelve.

> Down to the dark. The stone. The timber. Then nothing but dim Foxen’s

A heavy burden indeed, enough to jostle her about and let foxen slip..

<img src="/img/auri-water-foxen.png" height="600px" width="350px">

But duty is foremost in Auri's heart, and to lose the gear is unimaginable.

> Losing Foxen was bad. It would leave her blind and lonely in

> too. But neither of those things were wrong. Letting the metal slide into the

>
>  --18:TODO:284

and so she does it! Nearly drowned, but full of joy:

> Auri heaved the thing out of the water, and it struck the stone floor with the
> sound of a bell. It was a bright brass gear, big as a platter. Thicker than her
> thumb with some to spare. It had a hole in the middle, nine teeth, and a jagged

> trembled. Her heart was full of joy.
> 
> -- 19:TODO:298

Auri is kind and the world is kind in turn, and so foxen from it's depths is returned:

> But the thought of
> leaving Foxen in the dark was enough to put a fine, thin crack straight through

> 
> --20:TODO:310

She carries the gear, along with her other gifts back to port:

> The great
> brass gear was bright straight through. The key was black as black.
>

The gear would _almost_ make a gift for him...

> -- 23:TODO:351

But, it wasn't right yet and whats worse she can't seem to find the right place for it!

> -- 24:TODO:362

She sees if the crystal will put it to rights, she even tries resting it in Mantle, but it seems most content vexing her.
She leaves it there to sulk. Then resorts to flattery by placing it atop the mantelpiece beside her box of stone. What could possibly resist.... but no, not a peep from it. Auri is nearly angry with everything, but no, she knows it's her fault for not knowing its proper place. Maybe it doesn't want to be with her at all? A sad thought, but it may be the way of things, and that's the way things have to go. So she takes it back to the Twelve. She places it by the edge of the pool and gives it a moment to consider. To her delight, it doesn't want to go. She weighs some other locations, but nothing feels right. She rushes to see what's wrong with Tenance and sees to fixing a leaky pipe, the whole business is quite distressing, and she heads back to Mantle to calm down. After setting yourself to rights, she gathers up the brazen gear. She carries it on to Wains, maybe it belonged there, or perhaps it could help her find out what was wrong with the place. So she took it to her new sitting room and placed it upon the couch:

> Then into her new sitting room. She sat the brazen gear upon the couch

> 
> -- 59:TODO:965

Though she can't see to help the Fulcrum, it finds the strength to help her. As she runs her hands along its broken tooth it shows her what's amiss in the room. The bone button needs companionship.

> 
> -- 60:TODO:980

Things more set to right, she gathers the gear and heads back to mantle where set sets it above the fireplace, where it
seems sullen again. Maybe The sitting room was better? Auri has other things to be about. But she finds herself all turned untrue inside when she finds her blanket twisted in the corner. She tries to see if the gear will help, the horrid galling stubborn thing might it lend a hand? But no, of course not. She would like to blame things on the brazen thing, but she knows it's not true. She wishes the world would run like a well-oiled gear, but the oil seems to always run out. She is so chafed and chaffed inside, rubbed raw and empty. Later she tries to set herself to rights by making more of her perfect soap. You can't clean the world if you're a mess, after all. All seems right as honey until she sees the pomace is full of red screaming.

> -- 113:TODO:1768

She knew enough of red and screaming. It wouldn't do. She takes it to Boundry. Which isn't her place any longer. The experience leaves her ragged. She can't seem to fix anything, she wants some honey, but she knows she mustn't....
She feels the panic start to rise.

So Fulcrum is her rock on a stormy night. It's pride a pedestal; it's shimmerant a guiding light. As a reward, she takes Fulcrum to see Tree. It's the least she could do for its help. She makes some pea soup. She is nearly out of food... but she puts that out of her mind. After her soup, on the way back to Mantle, they encounter some scattered leaves, a bit of a mystery, really. She discovers where they came from and leaves her silver etched plate there. She checks on the vanity in Tumbrel again and then finally takes a well-deserved rest in Annulet.

There isn't much left to Fulcrums journey, but we can save the last bit for later. 


## Interlude: fourths and fallings

Whew, so now you have traveled around a bit with Fulcrum. He has been brazen, proud, sullen, vexing, stubborn, and answerful. He came from below, and he helped Auri in a tight spot. He is a symbol of motion, movement, and turnings. But he is also beautiful and broken.

Three times now, we have reached a turning point. Three times is the proper way, what the world will bear. All the stories agree on this: three gifts, three calls, three parts of silence. But we, like Auri, are not always proper. And so a final turn, hidden from the slight of men. A desperate gentle thing, a breath to set it into motion. So soft and pure creation itself bends, and bends and bends ... bends... and breaks. There is no thunderclap, no distant drum. The stars hang silently in the sky—only a slight change in the wind, a hesitation, a pull upward. As if the world hung by a string, now cut, and is falling.

We know from our last read this "Sitting Room" is part of the Fea. 
It has two pieces of furniture you can sit on: a couch and a velvet chair. Recall that Auri's hand reached under the couch to find the bone button. That implies some separation between things under the couch and things near the chair. 

It means a border, moving from darkness to the lights of the chandelier above. We are brave, young, and far from home and hearth. Our eyes, like our red haired heroes, used to twilight's haze,
adjust to daylight...

A tree, with power-blue blossoms.

Kvothe sees a blue topped tree, Auri see's a blue chair, but the voice among the leaves says it's neither:

> I am no tree. No more than is a man a chair.

Not a chair, but a thrown, not a tree, but a brazen gear:

## Epilogue

The world fails to make sense. Were spinning because if we stop then things will
come back into focus and that's so much worse. _Down, down, down._ Would this the fall
never come to an end? What are we to do...

_When the hearthfire turns to blue,_
<br>
_What to do? What to do?_
<br>
_Run outside. Run and hide._

_When your bright sword turns to rust?_
<br>
_Who to trust? Who to trust?_
<br>
_Stand alone. Standing stone._


_See a woman pale as snow?_
<br>
_Silent come and silent go._
<br>
_What’s their plan? What’s their plan?_

_Chandrian. Chandrian._
