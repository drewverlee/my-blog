This Post is a continuation of [shadows on the
wal](/posts-output/2021-1-25-findings) you should have read that first. As such
will continue quickly ahead. This is mostly from A SROST the chapter "Beautiful
and Broken". Like Shadows on the Wall, will cover Auri's journey as she sees it.
Then will walk it back and _see_ what really happens.

So, were back in Auri's sitting room, something is still wrong. Sad face. She tries
curling up with the Fulcrum on the coach:

> She sat the brazen gear upon the couch and curled up close beside it, tucking
> her feet underneath herself. It wasn’t any more content.

poor lonely fulcrum:

But the answer comes to her while touching caressing fulcrums edge, the bone button needs a friend.

She know calls the room Annulet in celebration:

Where at one point she takes a rest from carrying Fulcrum around, setting him on velvet
chair.

Lets turn this over and look at another way.

------

We know from our last post this is "Sitting Room" is part of the Fea
of it. It has two things you can sit on a couch and a velvet chair. Recall that
Auri's hand, reached under the couch to find the bone button. That implies some
separation between things under the couch and things near the chair. It means a
border, moving from darkness to the lights of the chandelier above. We are
brave, young and far from home and hearth. Our eyes, used to twilight's haze,
adjust to daylight...

A tree, with power-blue blossoms.

Kvothe sees a tree, Auri see's a chair, but the voices tell us it's neither:

> I am no tree. No more than is a man a chair.

Not a chair, but a thrown, not a tree, but a brazen gear:

> Fulcrum settled like a king upon the velvet chair

Auri puts a buckle near the button, its described as:

> Her hands flew to her pockets, looking for... Yes. Auri set the tarnished
> buckle down beside the button.

The buckle is 

* came from old leather etched with curling patterns - wind?
* black as coal - cinder has matte coal eyes. Menda to, but lets not go there right now.
* near resin    - cinder has the perfect white teeth of someone addicted

I wanna say this is Cinder near felurian. This could mean any number of things,
he is her son? 

Now lets head back to the Fulcrum. Auri breaks it... coming down some stairs on the 7th step:

> and struck the seventh stair so hard he cracked the stone and
> bounded back into the air, then spun again, fell flat upon his brazen face,

it breaks into three pieces

> Three jagged shapes
> with three teeth each. No longer a pin stuck hard into the heart of things. He
> had become three threes. 3 jagged shapes with 3 teeth each. Thats 9, suprise!
> Not seven then. Another thing she had been wrong about.

Surprise! 

### notes

## coal 

* menda coal black eyes and hair
* mahne is coal
* cinder has coal eyes
* cinder with felurian? could be her son, cured of cinder wash.

# belt

> The leather of the belt was turned against itself, but
> at the slightest tug the buckle came away. Both of them were better off that
> way.

## leather

* The leather of the belt was turned against itself

bast

> He felt endlessly turned against himself.

lanre

> turned against you,

likely lanre.

* The leather belt was etched in odd curling patterns. the lackless box.

* The belt stayed on the central table, obviously. 382 so no holly

## table

* holly berries and clean cloath @ 50 but then gone

## buckle

* black
* an old belt with a silver buckle so tarnished it was black as coal.
* on central table @ 670
* buckled moved to rest beside the dish with resin
* crowing the resin a bit

* near bone buckle so its bast?

#TODO fulcrum

> Annulet (architecture), a fillet or ring encircling a column
