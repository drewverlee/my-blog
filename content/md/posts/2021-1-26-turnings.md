This post is a continuation of [Shadows on the
wal](/posts-output/2021-1-25-findings). As such, we will quickly continue on.
Similar to before will cover Auri's journey as she sees it. Then will walk it
back and I'll show you what I see. As such, this is broken into several parts. I
feel broken into pieces, too; I hear a sharp ringing and try to pull myself
together. The world seems to swirl around and finally slows and coalesces into
something reasonable. Blue, bottles, and I catch my breath. We are back in
Auri's sitting room. Something real, something we can touch. I put my hand upon
the velvet chair. It feels normal, like sunlight and rugged, honesty wood
beneath. Auri insists something is still _wrong_ with the place. On top of that,
she can't find a proper place for Fulcrum. Which is sad, all things deserve
their place. Oh, I'm sorry I haven't introduced you to fulcrum. I'm terrible
sorry, how very rude of me.

## First Binding: A hard heavy weight of answers

Fulcrum didn't always go by that name. Auri gave it to it when ... what I doing? A _proper_ story starts at the beginning. 
So let's have a proper telling. On the first day, Auri found it in the deep dark below of the Twelve.

A heavy burden indeed, enough to jostle her about and let foxen slip..

<img src="/img/auri-water-foxen.png" height="600px" width="350px">

But duty is foremost in Auri's heart, and to lose the gear is unimaginable.

and so she does it! Nearly drowned, but full of joy:

Auri is kind and the world is kind in turn, and so foxen from it's depths is returned:

> But the thought of

She carries the gear, along with her other gifts back to port:

But, it wasn't right yet and whats worse she can't seem to find the right place for it!

She sees if the crystal will put it to rights, she even tries resting it in Mantle, but it seems most content vexing her.
She leaves it there to sulk. Then resorts to flattery by placing it atop the mantelpiece beside her box of stone. What could possibly resist.... but no, not a peep from it. Auri is nearly angry with everything, but no, she knows it's her fault for not knowing its proper place. Maybe it doesn't want to be with her at all? A sad thought, but it may be the way of things, and that's the way things have to go. So she takes it back to the Twelve. She places it by the edge of the pool and gives it a moment to consider. To her delight, it doesn't want to go. She weighs some other locations, but nothing feels right. She rushes to see what's wrong with Tenance and sees to fixing a leaky pipe, the whole business is quite distressing, and she heads back to Mantle to calm down. After setting yourself to rights, she gathers up the brazen gear. She carries it on to Wains, maybe it belonged there, or perhaps it could help her find out what was wrong with the place. So she took it to her new sitting room and placed it upon the couch:

Though she can't see to help the Fulcrum, it finds the strength to help her. As she runs her hands along its broken tooth it shows her what's amiss in the room. The bone button needs companionship.

Things more set to right, she gathers the gear and heads back to mantle where
set sets it above the fireplace, where it seems sullen again. Maybe The sitting
room was better? Auri has other things to be about. But she finds herself all
turned untrue inside when she finds her blanket twisted in the corner. She tries
to see if the gear will help, the horrid galling stubborn thing might it lend a
hand? But no, of course not. She would like to blame things on the brazen thing,
but she knows it's not true. She wishes the world would run like a well-oiled
gear, but the oil seems to always run out. She is so chafed and chaffed inside,
rubbed raw and empty. She needs to sets herself to rights, but even she can't get clean,
because something has taken her perfect soap!

Auri settles for a less satisfying bath in Mantle. But her rest is short, as she hears
a cry for help.

As so often is the case her, her kindness goes unrewarded. 


TODO move this?
Later she tries to set herself to rights by making more of her perfect soap. You
can't clean the world if you're a mess, after all.

She knew enough of red and screaming. It wouldn't do. She takes it to Boundry. Which isn't her place any longer. The experience leaves her ragged. She can't seem to fix anything, she wants some honey, but she knows she mustn't....

So Fulcrum is her rock on a stormy night. It's pride a pedestal; it's shimmerant a guiding light. As a reward, she takes Fulcrum to see Tree. It's the least she could do for its help. She makes some pea soup. She is nearly out of food... but she puts that out of her mind. After her soup, on the way back to Mantle, they encounter some scattered leaves, a bit of a mystery, really. She discovers where they came from and leaves her silver etched plate there. She checks on the vanity in Tumbrel again and then finally takes a well-deserved rest in Annulet.

## Interlude: TODO

## Second Binding: Towards the dark of a grim winters night

We catch up with Kvothe and Felurian after their terrifying experience in the fae. Kvothe wisely asks
no questions and together then continue their journey nightward.

As they start to lose the light Felurian calls out more gently then a cat and is answered by hundreds of small
flickering moth lights.

They find themselves in an open space, with vast darkness overhead. Kovthe feels the presence of 
something great sleeping here.

## Interlude: From Dust To Dawn

Felurian leads kvothe from twilight into night and back. Along the way back they stop a curtain and she pulls light
to weave into the his new shaed. Later we get a sense of how time and space works in the fae. Which is to say, nothing like 
they do in the mortal realm.

So you move _towards_ time. E.g you can walk towards dayward, as we see Kvothe do. 
Does that mean the less you move the less time passes? Trees must be very old indeed then.
If I had to summarize, I would say that in the real world time and space are linked and expanding.
In the Fae you can walk a whole day and return back to where you started. The natural right
shape might be one perfect circle. But things dont feel right to me, they feel turned against themselves.

## Interlude: TODO

Whew, so now you have traveled around a bit with Fulcrum. He has been brazen,
proud, sullen, vexing, stubborn, and answerful. He came from below, and he
helped Auri in a tight spot. He is a symbol of motion, movement, and turnings.
But he is also beautiful and broken. We have walked with Kvothe and felurian and
she has woven him a shaed TODO. We have hovered above 

Three times now, we have reached a turning point. Three times is the proper way,
what the world will bear. All the stories agree on this: three gifts, three
calls, three parts of silence. But we, like Auri, are not always proper. And so
a final turn, hidden from the slight of men. A desperate gentle thing, just breath
to set it into motion. So soft and pure creation itself bends, and bends and
bends ... bends... and breaks. There is no thunderclap, no distant drums. The
stars hang silently in the sky—only a slight change in the wind, a hesitation, then
slight pull upward. As if the world hung by a string, now cut, and is falling in the wind.


## Fourth Binding: TODO

We split again and our mind starts to reel, we see only flashes and searing pain.

from our past, from others pasts from the _future_. From nowhere, _from everywhere ..._



_The fae, there is but one center_

_dayward, lightward they end the same_

_The trees like mountains_

_climb past the pavilion and boles to the crown_

_...._

_through doors, over farm and bridge_

_The smell of leather and lemon_

_What lies behind the lights curtain_

_from something we pull the omethi_

_and find nearly a song_

_we push moteth from something_

_and find the we can sing once more_

_...._


We know from our last read this "Sitting Room" is part of the Fea. It has two
pieces of furniture you can sit on: a couch and a velvet chair. Recall that
Auri's hand reached under the couch to find the light. That implies some
separation between things under the couch and things near the velvet chair.

It means a border, moving from darkness to the lights of the chandelier above.
We are brave, young, and far from home and hearth. Our eyes, like our red haired
heroes, used to twilight's haze, adjust to daylight...

Kvothe sees a blue topped tree, Auri see's a blue chair, but the voice from the _crown_ tells us it is neither:

> I am no tree. No more than is a man a chair.

Not a chair, but a thrown.

> Fulcrum settled like a king upon the velvet chair

_The Fulcrum_

_The Fae_

The world fails to make sense. Were spinning because if we stop then things will
come back into focus and that's so much worse. _Down, down, down._ Would this the fall
never come to an end? What are we to do...

_When the hearthfire turns to blue,_
<br>
_What to do? What to do?_
<br>
_Run outside. Run and hide._

_When your bright sword turns to rust?_
<br>
_Who to trust? Who to trust?_
<br>
_Stand alone. Standing stone._


_See a woman pale as snow?_
<br>
_Silent come and silent go._

_What’s their plan? What’s their plan?_

_Chandrian. Chandrian._
