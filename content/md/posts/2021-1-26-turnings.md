This post is a continuation of [Shadows on the
wal](/posts-output/2021-1-25-findings). As such, we will quickly continue on.
Similar to before, will cover Auri's journey as she sees it. Then will walk it
back and I'll show you what I see. As such, this is broken into two parts.

So, were back in Auri's sitting room, something is still _wrong_ and on top of
that she can't find a proper place for Fulcrum. Which is sad, all things deserve
their place. She tries curling up with the Fulcrum on the, coach to see if that will help:

poor lonely fulcrum.

Where at one point she takes a rest from carrying Fulcrum around, setting him on velvet
chair.

We know from our last post this is "Sitting Room" is part of the Fea. 
It has two pieces of furniture you can sit on: a couch and a velvet chair. Recall that
Auri's hand, reached under the couch to find the bone button. That implies some
separation between things under the couch and things near the chair. 

It means a border, moving from darkness to the lights of the chandelier above. We are
brave, young and far from home and hearth. Our eyes, like our red haired heros, used to twilight's haze,
adjust to daylight...

A tree, with power-blue blossoms.

Kvothe sees a blue topped tree, Auri see's a blue chair, but the voice among the leaves says it's neither:

> I am no tree. No more than is a man a chair.

Not a chair, but a thrown, not a tree, but a brazen gear:

## Epilogue

The world fails to make sense. Were spinning because if we stop then things will
come back into focus and that's so much worse. Down, down, down. Would the fall
never come to an end? What are we to do...

_When the hearthfire turns to blue,_
<br>
_What to do? What to do?_
<br>
_Run outside. Run and hide._

_When your bright sword turns to rust?_
<br>
_Who to trust? Who to trust?_
<br>
_Stand alone. Standing stone._


_See a woman pale as snow?_
<br>
_Silent come and silent go._
<br>
_What’s their plan? What’s their plan?_

_Chandrian. Chandrian._

> Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of
